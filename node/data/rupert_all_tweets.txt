778746574390177800	Thu Sep 22 00:03:46 +0000 2016	Nothing is more exciting than being on that island with @JeffProbst for the best game show on Earth: @survivorcbs
766997529779118100	Sat Aug 20 13:57:15 +0000 2016	Going to the Colts preseason game today? Come and see us and park in the Monarch Beverage lot to benefit Rupert's Kids!

733090698065530900	Thu May 19 00:23:37 +0000 2016	Ok. One tweet. We like Cydney to win. She was our choice from the start. She's a bad ass woman! #SurvivorFinale

733088724888739800	Thu May 19 00:15:46 +0000 2016	It has been a long week and I am going to spend the night watching the finale with Laura. I hope it's a good one!
729029259356823600	Sat May 07 19:24:54 +0000 2016	I'll be the guest of @chrisspangle and @gtlenz at @MortysComedy on May 23 talking Rupert's Kids and politics.  https://t.co/s2wVLNfGSu
728025248470159400	Thu May 05 00:55:19 +0000 2016	It's always sad to see someone go. It's always heartbreaking when your torch gets snuffed.
728023147132293100	Thu May 05 00:46:58 +0000 2016	If you think there is a lot of crying on this episode, then you should see what happens off camera.
728022706810032100	Thu May 05 00:45:13 +0000 2016	It's good to see someone out hunting food.
728018898210021400	Thu May 05 00:30:05 +0000 2016	Banging right through this episode. #survivor
728017922065506300	Thu May 05 00:26:13 +0000 2016	There's a lot of back stabbing in this one.
728015546906615800	Thu May 05 00:16:46 +0000 2016	It's crazy how emotional you get out there... But I don't know about that much man love.
728015411569008600	Thu May 05 00:16:14 +0000 2016	Let's see is Jason and Tai can bond again.
728014741268881400	Thu May 05 00:13:34 +0000 2016	I have never seen this challenge. This is very cool. #Survivor
728014370450505700	Thu May 05 00:12:06 +0000 2016	THAT is a tan line.
728013972322934800	Thu May 05 00:10:31 +0000 2016	Wow. Rain in a challenge. You don't see that often.
728013450765434900	Thu May 05 00:08:27 +0000 2016	If they didn't see the grub as food, they are getting too much food. Of course the chicken ate that solid protein.
728012520590483500	Thu May 05 00:04:45 +0000 2016	It looks like it will be a very exciting #survivor
728012294018359300	Thu May 05 00:03:51 +0000 2016	Time for loyalty is done. It's time to play @survivorcbs for yourself!
727632110635368400	Tue May 03 22:53:08 +0000 2016	If you want to end the corruption of the Republicans and Democrats, you have to vote different. Vote Libertarian! @LPNational @LPIN
727631827515650000	Tue May 03 22:52:01 +0000 2016	Today was Primary Day. If you wanted to vote Libertarian but couldn't, this is why: https://t.co/UL0v6hClG1
727631676436824000	Tue May 03 22:51:25 +0000 2016	I'll be their guest! https://t.co/arXqDP90zZ
725488666190159900	Thu Apr 28 00:55:51 +0000 2016	THAT was an exciting @survivorcbs
725487387778928600	Thu Apr 28 00:50:46 +0000 2016	Their skin looks so good. There must not be too many bugs there.
725486630295994400	Thu Apr 28 00:47:46 +0000 2016	Scot does not seem happy.
725486581344309200	Thu Apr 28 00:47:34 +0000 2016	I wait all week and it's almost done! Two tribals make it move quick.
725484354940604400	Thu Apr 28 00:38:43 +0000 2016	Jason, you need to show that you're the perfect one to take to the end because you won't get a vote.
725484253631361000	Thu Apr 28 00:38:19 +0000 2016	Yikes. You don't want to show you're strong at day 29!
725483316443516900	Thu Apr 28 00:34:36 +0000 2016	Take your sweet time. No one seems in a hurry!
725482904873263100	Thu Apr 28 00:32:57 +0000 2016	You can taste the end at 29 days.
725481765410869200	Thu Apr 28 00:28:26 +0000 2016	That fourth time just didn't seem like it counted
725481705566535700	Thu Apr 28 00:28:12 +0000 2016	Man, I would love to play again.
725481439739928600	Thu Apr 28 00:27:08 +0000 2016	Don't get too cocky Sydney
725480683469201400	Thu Apr 28 00:24:08 +0000 2016	Those showers are so nice. You didn't ask for permission. Nothing was stopping you.
725477440940814300	Thu Apr 28 00:11:15 +0000 2016	Ok. Better than a glass of water and an umbrella.
725477283851542500	Thu Apr 28 00:10:37 +0000 2016	Sweet. A challenge right away. Let's see if the challenge is worth anything. "Here's an umbrella."
725475949433774100	Thu Apr 28 00:05:19 +0000 2016	Sydney's face shows she isn't with Thai.
725474923674800100	Thu Apr 28 00:01:15 +0000 2016	I can't be mad at Thai. If he had given up the idol he would have gone home.
717878425764008000	Thu Apr 07 00:55:28 +0000 2016	That was a very good #Survivor
717878215843274800	Thu Apr 07 00:54:38 +0000 2016	Arrogant and cocky will always know you out.
717877209822683100	Thu Apr 07 00:50:38 +0000 2016	The game never stops. If you're not talking to someone, they are talking about you.
717876830838063100	Thu Apr 07 00:49:08 +0000 2016	Nicky has been cocky through the whole show and that's hard to live with.
717876459386179600	Thu Apr 07 00:47:40 +0000 2016	I love this game and show. It's so mentally challenging too. You never know what can happen. #Survivor
717875834996953100	Thu Apr 07 00:45:11 +0000 2016	I love Cydney's hat!
717874484699508700	Thu Apr 07 00:39:49 +0000 2016	After three weeks, you start to smell. And I haven't seen them wash off in the ocean much.
717874352591482900	Thu Apr 07 00:39:17 +0000 2016	I think Jeff hated that hug.
717874247373205500	Thu Apr 07 00:38:52 +0000 2016	He's a huggy little fella.
717873388040167400	Thu Apr 07 00:35:27 +0000 2016	This challenge seems like it's only been ten minutes. Man up! #Survivor
717873060397858800	Thu Apr 07 00:34:09 +0000 2016	I never stepped down for food even when I knew I was safe. But Jeff would make me so mad. #Survivor
717872394740871200	Thu Apr 07 00:31:30 +0000 2016	When I did this, my feet barely fit. The girls look like they were on two by fours.
717872172048519200	Thu Apr 07 00:30:37 +0000 2016	If they don't go for at least five hours, they are weak. #Survivor
717871022964342800	Thu Apr 07 00:26:03 +0000 2016	She has to keep calm and subtle or else you go home. #Survivor
717870950658744300	Thu Apr 07 00:25:46 +0000 2016	I hope Sydney can keep control of herself.
717870505982877700	Thu Apr 07 00:24:00 +0000 2016	They are showing Sydney a lot. I hope she isn't going home. Post merger, go after muscle.
717870223592988700	Thu Apr 07 00:22:53 +0000 2016	No one ever talks about an all boy alliance. #Survivor
717868922113036300	Thu Apr 07 00:17:43 +0000 2016	There's always crying in #Survivor. Laura said she lost track of the days she cried in Survivor. She claims it was because of me.
717868126373822500	Thu Apr 07 00:14:33 +0000 2016	They just held on to Scott.
717868078449745900	Thu Apr 07 00:14:21 +0000 2016	Scott has the advantage in every physical challenge.
717867569189924900	Thu Apr 07 00:12:20 +0000 2016	Scott needs to sit the girl on the pole and run with it. #Survivor
717867415565152300	Thu Apr 07 00:11:43 +0000 2016	These reward challenges aren't really rewarding. #Survivor
717867338176065500	Thu Apr 07 00:11:25 +0000 2016	The big guy can't just put her on the poll and carry her!?
717867261806166000	Thu Apr 07 00:11:07 +0000 2016	One of the reasons I never won an immunity challenge is that I'd win a reward challenge and be sluggish the next day. #survivor
717866949783453700	Thu Apr 07 00:09:52 +0000 2016	Cool! A challenge! #SurvivorKaohRong #Survivor #BrainsBrawnBeauty #
717866806409568300	Thu Apr 07 00:09:18 +0000 2016	Laura and I like Sydney. She's our pick. #Survivor
717866199279906800	Thu Apr 07 00:06:53 +0000 2016	When watching Survivor do you prefer the evil villains or the less rotten ok guys? (No one is an angel on #survivor)
717865602979905500	Thu Apr 07 00:04:31 +0000 2016	I wonder who showed him what leaves to eat. It's scary to sit and pick random leaves out there. #survivor
717865264323366900	Thu Apr 07 00:03:10 +0000 2016	I've seen a man bun. I don't know what that is. #Survivor
717865204399415300	Thu Apr 07 00:02:56 +0000 2016	I'm a big fan of the chicken this season. #Survivor
715340834707628000	Thu Mar 31 00:52:00 +0000 2016	Ugh. Just give him antibiotics!
715340678583029800	Thu Mar 31 00:51:22 +0000 2016	The cleaner spot was still outside with less brush.
715340022711328800	Thu Mar 31 00:48:46 +0000 2016	I haven't seen anything as bad as what I had in Pearl Islands or All Stars.
715339568724095000	Thu Mar 31 00:46:58 +0000 2016	You can trust a Dr. Rupert.
715333823269998600	Thu Mar 31 00:24:08 +0000 2016	I hope a challenge is coming soon.
715332659807854600	Thu Mar 31 00:19:30 +0000 2016	Here are your two choices for Indiana Governor. I am supporting Rex Bell for the @lpin nomination.  https://t.co/M0uDSUuhgc
715331833253089300	Thu Mar 31 00:16:13 +0000 2016	You don't spill your guts if you're trying to build an alliance! #Survivor
715331553069387800	Thu Mar 31 00:15:07 +0000 2016	Michelle is a favorite of Laura and I. We haven't seen much of her. Makes me think she's made it far in the game. We hope so.
715331141553623000	Thu Mar 31 00:13:29 +0000 2016	Debbie... I don't know what to say.
715330657489039400	Thu Mar 31 00:11:33 +0000 2016	The best part of the merge is the food! #Survivor
715329576197603300	Thu Mar 31 00:07:15 +0000 2016	So many annoying players...
715328721889181700	Thu Mar 31 00:03:52 +0000 2016	A chicken isn't a pet. It's food.
715328683645517800	Thu Mar 31 00:03:43 +0000 2016	It's a #Survivor curse. People get cocky on the island.
715328414182481900	Thu Mar 31 00:02:38 +0000 2016	A boat AND a raft? It's like the #survivor yacht club.
710269682431828000	Thu Mar 17 01:01:03 +0000 2016	Thanks to all of the people that came to raise money for Rupert's Kids this past weekend. And to our guest @ejsnyder333!
710269433369866200	Thu Mar 17 01:00:03 +0000 2016	I am not running for Governor of Indiana in 2016. Please look at Rex Bell. https://t.co/8KkhndEab9. The R's and D's have let us down.
710268249829548000	Thu Mar 17 00:55:21 +0000 2016	I want to be the first player to do five seasons. I feel like this last one doesn't count because I let Laura play. https://t.co/lwZP1CsbtM
710266364347330600	Thu Mar 17 00:47:52 +0000 2016	I personally would like to see Peter go home because of his arrogance.
710265096165982200	Thu Mar 17 00:42:49 +0000 2016	Happy birthday to my momma Georgette. She's 80 today. 80 more to go! https://t.co/9r7sO67LJu
710264335310807000	Thu Mar 17 00:39:48 +0000 2016	Aww. I like all of those guys. I hate to see one of them go home. I bet they send home a beauty.
710263122657816600	Thu Mar 17 00:34:59 +0000 2016	Scot is so tall he can almost run to the net.
710263087471968300	Thu Mar 17 00:34:50 +0000 2016	Thanks to our friends at @StJosephBrewery for providing "refreshments" at this past weekend's fundraiser for RK. https://t.co/HnfjOd4skt
710262652493115400	Thu Mar 17 00:33:07 +0000 2016	Finally a good challenge! I love the action.
710261887141711900	Thu Mar 17 00:30:04 +0000 2016	Take it from someone that has gone home because of cockiness... Cut it out.  https://t.co/phhpD1CBHt
710261383061868500	Thu Mar 17 00:28:04 +0000 2016	Aww she's by herself all alone with her ant friends.
710260655945744400	Thu Mar 17 00:25:11 +0000 2016	I like seeing the sweeter side of @ScotPollard31 on #survivor
710260480040775700	Thu Mar 17 00:24:29 +0000 2016	He could pick him up with one hand and put him in the tree.
710260283357274100	Thu Mar 17 00:23:42 +0000 2016	Join us for Rupert‚Äôs Bicycle Jamboree on May 21 - https://t.co/XyAieoyBNt
710259502692433900	Thu Mar 17 00:20:36 +0000 2016	Laura says she agrees there is no need for exercise in #survivor
710259412271652900	Thu Mar 17 00:20:14 +0000 2016	When you're showing off with pull-ups and calling yourself the mastermind, that cockiness bites you in the behind.
710258662262972400	Thu Mar 17 00:17:15 +0000 2016	You don't need exercise on #survivor. Go get firewood instead.
710257696994254800	Thu Mar 17 00:13:25 +0000 2016	I've been in these tribe shuffles. They can't be rigged. They are completely random. No one knows that happens and all are surprised.
710257304566767600	Thu Mar 17 00:11:52 +0000 2016	There's a lot of hugging going on. Let's see how long that hugging goes on.
710257252519665700	Thu Mar 17 00:11:39 +0000 2016	Join us June 18th for our #poker tournament! #survivor #indianapolis #indiana # https://t.co/CjDwouB9gs

708457146292281300	Sat Mar 12 00:58:40 +0000 2016	We are working with Open Door Equine. They are a great equine therapy organization. https://t.co/APk8x62s77 https://t.co/4wjYnrmE8u

707746396645007400	Thu Mar 10 01:54:24 +0000 2016	Hopefully it unifies the brawn tribe.
707746091354222600	Thu Mar 10 01:53:12 +0000 2016	Sometimes it is so hard to keep your mouth shut.
707745513781792800	Thu Mar 10 01:50:54 +0000 2016	It's going to be a fun few hours in camp. #survivor
707744750699475000	Thu Mar 10 01:47:52 +0000 2016	Brains are struggling.

707740668886708200	Thu Mar 10 01:31:39 +0000 2016	Caleb, along with every other #survivor, wants to play again. Even if it almost kills you!
707740119235760100	Thu Mar 10 01:29:28 +0000 2016	In #Survivor, you wouldn't believe how close to death you sometimes are. This is a very real game. @survivorcbs
707739970698616800	Thu Mar 10 01:28:52 +0000 2016	They sewed me up and bandaged broken bones. But if they call the chopper, you are done. What an emotional #Survivor.
707738346450190300	Thu Mar 10 01:22:25 +0000 2016	There are possibly a hundred(s) of people on that island for the show and now you see why they need them. #survivor
707737424697413600	Thu Mar 10 01:18:45 +0000 2016	A record number of shots of the camera crew.
707737315452592100	Thu Mar 10 01:18:19 +0000 2016	How many people are going to fallout?
707736538709430300	Thu Mar 10 01:15:14 +0000 2016	You can see their spine and bones. Skeletons. #survivor
707735810750193700	Thu Mar 10 01:12:21 +0000 2016	Is @survivorcbs the only great reality TV show? https://t.co/TuMtHdNQt6
707735312659775500	Thu Mar 10 01:10:22 +0000 2016	It's hard to keep going when you know you're not going to win.  @survivorcbs
707734789923721200	Thu Mar 10 01:08:17 +0000 2016	#Survivor is STILL the toughest game show out there. It darn near killed me.

672232909000990700	Thu Dec 03 01:56:29 +0000 2015	Laura and I want to send our thoughts and prayers to all of those effected by today's shootings.
672232521980080100	Thu Dec 03 01:54:57 +0000 2015	That was a game changing vote. #Survivor

672229483785646100	Thu Dec 03 01:42:53 +0000 2015	Hopefully they feed him before they vote him out?
672228153352454100	Thu Dec 03 01:37:35 +0000 2015	Laura said he looked pale.
672227905234182100	Thu Dec 03 01:36:36 +0000 2015	Trying to concentrate so this thing doesn't hit you in the face and Jeff doesn't stop talking.
672226926442979300	Thu Dec 03 01:32:43 +0000 2015	Where are the #Survivor helmets?
672226832163426300	Thu Dec 03 01:32:20 +0000 2015	Why is it that the girls always think about a girl alliance, but boys never do. #Survivor
672225705548079100	Thu Dec 03 01:27:52 +0000 2015	Spencer may help the girl alliance get Joe out and before you know it, he is next. #Survivor
672225594235482100	Thu Dec 03 01:27:25 +0000 2015	That's what makes you so crazy. You think you know which way the game is going and then you realize you have no idea. #Survivor
672225032702066700	Thu Dec 03 01:25:11 +0000 2015	Don't we all wish we had that type of relationship with our dad.
672224875088515100	Thu Dec 03 01:24:34 +0000 2015	Laura says the dad is better looking than the son. But then again, she likes the rugged type.
672224012358049800	Thu Dec 03 01:21:08 +0000 2015	When Laura came out on All Stars, the bugs ate her alive. Not sure if that had been a reward or punishment for her.
672223470802063400	Thu Dec 03 01:18:59 +0000 2015	Even winning is set up to make someone feel really good and someone really bad in a reward challenge.
672222900892504000	Thu Dec 03 01:16:43 +0000 2015	What a mean challenge. #Survivor

664622498441367600	Thu Nov 12 01:55:26 +0000 2015	And a memorable exit.
664622343134679000	Thu Nov 12 01:54:49 +0000 2015	One of the most exciting and unpredictable tribal counsels ever. Wow. #Survivor
664621612365287400	Thu Nov 12 01:51:55 +0000 2015	Enough with the eye rolling.
664620399456485400	Thu Nov 12 01:47:05 +0000 2015	In my first game, Pearl Islands, I went to my first tribal on day 21.
664620116781301800	Thu Nov 12 01:45:58 +0000 2015	No one in Survivor is more dangerous than another. It just matter who has the trust of the group at the moment.
664619302977318900	Thu Nov 12 01:42:44 +0000 2015	Those three girls looked like see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
664617975941435400	Thu Nov 12 01:37:28 +0000 2015	Wow. I am impressed
664616329136070700	Thu Nov 12 01:30:55 +0000 2015	Laura said she hopes this is something Joe is good at.
664613888529313800	Thu Nov 12 01:21:13 +0000 2015	You gotta love Keith. He's trying not to make eye contact with anyone.
664612291099291600	Thu Nov 12 01:14:52 +0000 2015	Winning is exciting until you realize you've slowed yourself down for tomorrow's immunity challenge with today's reward.
664611781701058600	Thu Nov 12 01:12:51 +0000 2015	Part of what makes this good television are these small things that you might not notice.
664611584224833500	Thu Nov 12 01:12:04 +0000 2015	Listening to Jeff will get you freaked out. It's a long challenge and you don't need to hurry as much as you think. I got but several times.
664610928277631000	Thu Nov 12 01:09:27 +0000 2015	The reward hurts you after twenty days on no sugar and no caffeine. #Survivor
664609514751160300	Thu Nov 12 01:03:50 +0000 2015	You think you know who you can trust in @Survivor_Tweet, but you don't. There are so many levels. #Survivor
662085815032385500	Thu Nov 05 01:55:33 +0000 2015	She knew she would get some votes. Why is she leaving mad? #Survivor
662085186134241300	Thu Nov 05 01:53:03 +0000 2015	It takes a loooong time to do tribal council. You can be sitting there for an hour while people vote and then they are tallied. #Survivor
662084147372953600	Thu Nov 05 01:48:56 +0000 2015	Thirteen is a big tribe. It's very difficult to navigate within that.
662081674511945700	Thu Nov 05 01:39:06 +0000 2015	When Jeff talks during the challenges, it is very distracting. It's great for the viewer, but adds another layer of challenge. #Survivor
662080447501856800	Thu Nov 05 01:34:14 +0000 2015	Poor Stephen. Of course he is out first. #Survivor
662079763385716700	Thu Nov 05 01:31:31 +0000 2015	I love how Keith is able to stay out of all of it.
662078072783417300	Thu Nov 05 01:24:48 +0000 2015	We've been waiting on chaos Cass. Maybe she's finally been released.
662074459906437100	Thu Nov 05 01:10:26 +0000 2015	It becomes a completely different game when the merge happens. Every alliance is put to the test. #Survivor

659528784081621000	Thu Oct 29 00:34:50 +0000 2015	It's all protein. As long as you can keep it down you don't mind. This is making me hungry. #Survivor
659527018153840600	Thu Oct 29 00:27:49 +0000 2015	Stephen is going to try too hard and end up having the tribe turn against him. #survivor
659526663110160400	Thu Oct 29 00:26:24 +0000 2015	Strength is not Stephen's strong suit. That kind of talk scares him. #Survivor
659526265947295700	Thu Oct 29 00:24:49 +0000 2015	You're really going to argue with Jeff Foxworthy on cooking in the woods? #Survivor
659526002024955900	Thu Oct 29 00:23:46 +0000 2015	What a great shot of Savage in his testimonial. @Survivor_Tweet is the most beautifully shot show on TV.
659524905059291100	Thu Oct 29 00:19:25 +0000 2015	I meant as in it isn't functional. My wife is sitting next to me. I'm not risking life and limb. Lol https://t.co/jLe5QJ0CxB
659524540867829800	Thu Oct 29 00:17:58 +0000 2015	NEVER get too cocky in #Survivor
659524189993365500	Thu Oct 29 00:16:34 +0000 2015	It's fried chicken. But it's jungle fried chicken. But it's a mental defeat if you're not eating it. #Survivor
659524042941050900	Thu Oct 29 00:15:59 +0000 2015	Nothing like a string bikini in a challenge. #Survivor

659522500296970200	Thu Oct 29 00:09:52 +0000 2015	Survivor makes you appreciate your family more. I was so glad to be able to take Laura. It made us a stronger couple.
659522092321259500	Thu Oct 29 00:08:14 +0000 2015	"Family emergency" gives you chills. #survivor
659521984347267100	Thu Oct 29 00:07:49 +0000 2015	A challenge in the first seven minutes of the game? I love it. #Survivor
659521504812535800	Thu Oct 29 00:05:54 +0000 2015	This would have happened months ago so I hope everything is ok. #Survivor
659521322414792700	Thu Oct 29 00:05:11 +0000 2015	Real life takes priority when you are faced with it in the game. There was zero question about what to do. #Survivor
659521094081052700	Thu Oct 29 00:04:16 +0000 2015	It's never good when Jeff shows up to camp. That's a terrible way to leave, worrying the whole way home. #PrayersforDanny #Survivor
656998253809049600	Thu Oct 22 00:59:24 +0000 2015	Take it from someone that has been voted out of #Survivor many times... It sucks.

656991939586322400	Thu Oct 22 00:34:19 +0000 2015	Laura just said she can't believe she played this silly game. She says it's surreal to watch it after playing it. #Survivor

656989926530162700	Thu Oct 22 00:26:19 +0000 2015	The hardest thing when fishing was doing it alone. Take off fish the spear, and sticking it on a vine tied to your waist. #Survivor
656989348206874600	Thu Oct 22 00:24:01 +0000 2015	They all act as if they are alone for the first time.

654459843298758700	Thu Oct 15 00:52:40 +0000 2015	Savage grinned because they aren't focused on him. Sandra won on the "anyone but me" mantra. #Survivor
654458821503352800	Thu Oct 15 00:48:36 +0000 2015	"I miss Abi" is the biggest lie on #Survivor since "My grandma died." #Survivor
654458414852997100	Thu Oct 15 00:47:00 +0000 2015	I get it. I'm still mad at @JonnyFairplay for writing my name down twice. I can't wait to get him back. #Survivor

649375285834420200	Thu Oct 01 00:08:27 +0000 2015	Jeff is already playing both sides of the game. I wonder how long before he gets caught. #SurvivorCambodia #SurvivorSecondChance #Survivor

596115185011662800	Thu May 07 00:51:50 +0000 2015	"It isn't me going home" are the famous last words at Tribal Council. #Survivor
596114984758857700	Thu May 07 00:51:02 +0000 2015	Does that mean Rodney is going home? #Survivor
596114202558881800	Thu May 07 00:47:55 +0000 2015	People forget that was her promise for the tribe. #Surivivor
596114115808067600	Thu May 07 00:47:35 +0000 2015	I can't believe Dan isn't pushing mama C for the white collar idol. #Survivor

593579452283490300	Thu Apr 30 00:55:44 +0000 2015	That was a pretty darn good episode of #Survivor.
593579358557634600	Thu Apr 30 00:55:21 +0000 2015	Ohhh. I think they mind. Just wait till they get back to camp. #Survivor
593579185148309500	Thu Apr 30 00:54:40 +0000 2015	Very rarely do you see clapping at a tribal council. #Surivivor
593578511685718000	Thu Apr 30 00:51:59 +0000 2015	Things like this makes everyone in the jury smile a lot. They love the squirming and the drama. #Survivor
593576843250311200	Thu Apr 30 00:45:22 +0000 2015	Hi Joe. We miss you. #Survivor
593576312184262700	Thu Apr 30 00:43:15 +0000 2015	I think Dan just told Mike how to use his idol... #Survivor
593574730659139600	Thu Apr 30 00:36:58 +0000 2015	The episode goes fast and there is more excitement with two challenges. #Survivor
593574497153777700	Thu Apr 30 00:36:02 +0000 2015	If Mike gave his hidden idol to Shirin, then they could change the entire game. #Survivor
593572778449588200	Thu Apr 30 00:29:13 +0000 2015	I hope this lasts for hours! #Survivor
593572734036095000	Thu Apr 30 00:29:02 +0000 2015	Two immunities... See? #Survivor can be nice sometimes.
593572293374148600	Thu Apr 30 00:27:17 +0000 2015	Sweet! Another challenge!
593571059212759000	Thu Apr 30 00:22:23 +0000 2015	It is good to see them get back to a really cool reward. That is so fun to watch. #Survivor

593570414153969700	Thu Apr 30 00:19:49 +0000 2015	Remember your three C's Rodney. Calm, Cool and Collected.
593569728855048200	Thu Apr 30 00:17:06 +0000 2015	I really don't have a favorite player. I can't tell you who I am rooting for. It is like, "Who do you hate the least?" #Survivor
593569211290550300	Thu Apr 30 00:15:02 +0000 2015	Loved that Challenge. #Survivor
593569156982657000	Thu Apr 30 00:14:49 +0000 2015	At least the tribe of eaters will appreciate the award more.
593568701170851800	Thu Apr 30 00:13:00 +0000 2015	Yikes... Did Dan break a collar bone?
593568295237787600	Thu Apr 30 00:11:24 +0000 2015	How big of a flip can he do?? #Survivor
593566811360112600	Thu Apr 30 00:05:30 +0000 2015	I don't feel sorry for either of them. Move on.

591042106673659900	Thu Apr 23 00:53:13 +0000 2015	That was a very exciting #tribalcouncil
591040722872049700	Thu Apr 23 00:47:43 +0000 2015	They aren't starving if they aren't eating the head. The cheeks are the sweetest part of that fish. #Survivor
591039245457883100	Thu Apr 23 00:41:51 +0000 2015	Who else thinks Will is going to go insane at tribal? #Survivor
591038756720812000	Thu Apr 23 00:39:55 +0000 2015	Mike is growing on Laura and I. #Survivor
591038514273235000	Thu Apr 23 00:38:57 +0000 2015	With Joe gone, we will now see who emerges as the #Survivor tough guy.
591037247413092400	Thu Apr 23 00:33:55 +0000 2015	It is just so exciting. #Survivor gets in your blood.
591037129939034100	Thu Apr 23 00:33:27 +0000 2015	What a mean game. Why would I want to play this again? #IDo #Survivor
591036471848542200	Thu Apr 23 00:30:50 +0000 2015	Sometimes you lose your mind in #Survivor. #WHOVOTEDFORME
591036223461822500	Thu Apr 23 00:29:51 +0000 2015	Now you are just being mean... Coming from the guy that didn't get a letter from home. #Survivor
591035176395800600	Thu Apr 23 00:25:41 +0000 2015	BTW, you don't have to wait until someone is stuck on an island to write a loved one a letter, and it will mean just as much. #Survivor
591034908190978000	Thu Apr 23 00:24:37 +0000 2015	It is only an advantage if you can use it as an advantage. A double vote isn't that great of advantage. #SayAdvantageAgain #survivor
591034155523121200	Thu Apr 23 00:21:38 +0000 2015	Wow... So much love on #Survivor right now.
591034085146890200	Thu Apr 23 00:21:21 +0000 2015	Letters from home are absolute gold. #survivor
591033045785780200	Thu Apr 23 00:17:13 +0000 2015	Nothing makes you more relaxed than a large man yelling "YOU BETTER RELAX" in your direction.
591032541382975500	Thu Apr 23 00:15:13 +0000 2015	That is a good man! Most #Survivor players would not have done what he just did.
591032007557124100	Thu Apr 23 00:13:06 +0000 2015	I would say that the one who needed the advantage won it, but they all need the advantage.
591031754439295000	Thu Apr 23 00:12:05 +0000 2015	Oh the #Survivor drama. This game makes you insane.

588504055493828600	Thu Apr 16 00:47:55 +0000 2015	This game makes you crazy!! #Survivor
588501756671299600	Thu Apr 16 00:38:47 +0000 2015	It is so odd to see someone fight so hard in challenges because she wants to leave. #Survivor
588501475229356000	Thu Apr 16 00:37:40 +0000 2015	An increase in music intensity always someone is dropping out.
588500282516049900	Thu Apr 16 00:32:55 +0000 2015	If this challenge doesn't go an hour, I will be disappointed.

588497494474104800	Thu Apr 16 00:21:51 +0000 2015	How many bribes can you sneak back for tribe-mates? #Survivor
588496368622272500	Thu Apr 16 00:17:22 +0000 2015	She just articulated why most Survivors want to go back!
588495369828433900	Thu Apr 16 00:13:24 +0000 2015	You can hear the skin screeching on the slide. Oof. #Survivor
588495144200106000	Thu Apr 16 00:12:30 +0000 2015	I say this before he falls... This is Will's best challenge yet. I have gained a lot of respect for him. #Survivor

588494829044269000	Thu Apr 16 00:11:15 +0000 2015	OUCH. #Survivor
588494344849612800	Thu Apr 16 00:09:20 +0000 2015	I love an intricate and long challenge. You can mess up and still win the challenge. #Survivor
588493057202516000	Thu Apr 16 00:04:13 +0000 2015	When someone wants to go home, you let them. Otherwise, they whine and cry all day long. And you get three more days! #survivor
585969017086672900	Thu Apr 09 00:54:35 +0000 2015	Ugh. That is the worst walk of shame you'll ever take. #survivor
585967859739664400	Thu Apr 09 00:49:59 +0000 2015	That is a giant tribe. #Survivor
585965610007310300	Thu Apr 09 00:41:02 +0000 2015	He's athletic. He's smart. He is quick. Joe is a triple threat. #survivor
585964304098172900	Thu Apr 09 00:35:51 +0000 2015	I love this time period in #survivor. At day 22, you're just getting into it.
585964101488156700	Thu Apr 09 00:35:03 +0000 2015	Now who won the reward challenge? #survivor
585963002542698500	Thu Apr 09 00:30:41 +0000 2015	It is always interesting to see someone tell everyone how to play the game, but they aren't doing much in the game. #Survivor
585962753887604700	Thu Apr 09 00:29:41 +0000 2015	98% of the time someone says they "are just trying to be nice" they are actually just being a jerk. #Survivor
585962360419950600	Thu Apr 09 00:28:08 +0000 2015	What is worse than everyone know you have an #ImmunityIdol? Everyone knowing you have an immunity idol and not having an immunity idol.
585961117660258300	Thu Apr 09 00:23:11 +0000 2015	It is nice to see a player in the game... Someone that acts and thinks strategically, but doesn't act like a jerk. #survivor
585960922839003100	Thu Apr 09 00:22:25 +0000 2015	Unless that soda contains an immunity idol. #survivor
585960711114764300	Thu Apr 09 00:21:34 +0000 2015	Your body does not take the soda and beer well. #survivor
585959893946933200	Thu Apr 09 00:18:19 +0000 2015	THAT is why I like separating reward and immunity challenges. The action is doubled and more exciting! #survivor
585958982273015800	Thu Apr 09 00:14:42 +0000 2015	I think Joe is the one to beat in this game. He has the potential to run the board on challenges. #Survivor
585958376787419100	Thu Apr 09 00:12:18 +0000 2015	Poor Rodney. Jeff is ALWAYS the final word, though. #Survivor
585958135593992200	Thu Apr 09 00:11:20 +0000 2015	I've won island pizza as a reward. It isn't the pizza you are used to. "Reward" is a strong word. Papa Johns doesn't deliver there #Survivor
585957879955365900	Thu Apr 09 00:10:19 +0000 2015	Ooo, an early challenge! Maybe we get two this episode. #Survivor
585957666465259500	Thu Apr 09 00:09:28 +0000 2015	I cannot believe how much food they still have after the merge! They still have a large spread. #Survivor
583431065697681400	Thu Apr 02 00:49:40 +0000 2015	Nothing is sadder than leaving with an idol in your pocket... And no, you can't take them as souvenirs. #Survivor
583427357576429600	Thu Apr 02 00:34:56 +0000 2015	As if this challenge wasn't tough enough... This cannot last much longer with the rain. #Survivor
583426211830968300	Thu Apr 02 00:30:23 +0000 2015	This is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical challenge. Can you control your mind? Can you focus on something other than pain?
583425876488036400	Thu Apr 02 00:29:03 +0000 2015	Wow. This is a tough one. Who has the upper hand? #Survivor
583425639237156900	Thu Apr 02 00:28:06 +0000 2015	Excellent! A challenge!
583425504939810800	Thu Apr 02 00:27:34 +0000 2015	I am not sure if you see the commercials I see, but "Mediterranean Tacos" made me laugh. #Arbys

580895510996787200	Thu Mar 26 00:54:16 +0000 2015	Looks like more than one person felt that #blindside
580892962889953300	Thu Mar 26 00:44:09 +0000 2015	Gosh! I miss playing the game #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart

580891161356681200	Thu Mar 26 00:36:59 +0000 2015	Could this #immunitychallenge be anymore painful to watch? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580889553025642500	Thu Mar 26 00:30:36 +0000 2015	You NEVER throw an #immunitychallenge #survivor101 #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580887474894835700	Thu Mar 26 00:22:21 +0000 2015	At least SOMEONE is out there fishing! #pelican #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580887358234488800	Thu Mar 26 00:21:53 +0000 2015	One of the best things about a #survivor reward is seeing something that hardly anyone else gets too #SurvivorWorldsApart #seaturtles
580886943656845300	Thu Mar 26 00:20:14 +0000 2015	It's amazing how a reward can make things OK... For a little bit, anyway. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580885837417590800	Thu Mar 26 00:15:50 +0000 2015	Guess that win came with a little #girlpower (and Will was there too) #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580884916478435300	Thu Mar 26 00:12:11 +0000 2015	Imagine that... Will pulling the rear AGAIN #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580884720625401900	Thu Mar 26 00:11:24 +0000 2015	YES! Another early #RewardChallenge in this episode #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
580881843471298600	Wed Mar 25 23:59:58 +0000 2015	Hoping my friends in Oklahoma stay safe with all the tornado activity taking place tonight!
580879326981148700	Wed Mar 25 23:49:58 +0000 2015	Are you getting ready for tonight's episode of #survivor ?#SurvivorWorldsApart Only about 10 minutes to get in front of a TV &amp; tweet w/ me
578375471810895900	Thu Mar 19 02:00:32 +0000 2015	That was a classy exit. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578374480201920500	Thu Mar 19 01:56:36 +0000 2015	That was a mouth-dropping #blindside #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578374253655011300	Thu Mar 19 01:55:42 +0000 2015	When there's not much difference in physicality, it's all about #camplife #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578372624851554300	Thu Mar 19 01:49:14 +0000 2015	Any time you're that confident, you're done. Trust me. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578372159841689600	Thu Mar 19 01:47:23 +0000 2015	No matter how much planning you do before #tribalcouncil , it can all change in an instant. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578369773207203800	Thu Mar 19 01:37:54 +0000 2015	In a physical challenge, it's clear who's going to tribal with these new tribes. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578368206194229200	Thu Mar 19 01:31:40 +0000 2015	That's not what an apology looks like. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578363706012254200	Thu Mar 19 01:13:47 +0000 2015	It really sucks when @JeffProbst tells you, "Got nothing for ya!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578362816148701200	Thu Mar 19 01:10:15 +0000 2015	That's one heckuva #reward ! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart

578359987216351200	Thu Mar 19 00:59:01 +0000 2015	Didn't think #tribalcouncil was going THAT way. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578358419339378700	Thu Mar 19 00:52:47 +0000 2015	It's so bittersweet for a #survivor fan to be at your first #tribalcouncil. UR lighting ur torch, but UR at tribal. #SurvivorWorldsApart
578357708828459000	Thu Mar 19 00:49:57 +0000 2015	Is cocky one of the #3Cs ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578356377329905700	Thu Mar 19 00:44:40 +0000 2015	And now the game begins for the Blue Collar tribe. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578355997065887700	Thu Mar 19 00:43:09 +0000 2015	The tide has REALLY turned for the Blue and No Collar tribes. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578354731271069700	Thu Mar 19 00:38:07 +0000 2015	I want to root for Will, but he's gotta give me something to root for! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578354338449350700	Thu Mar 19 00:36:34 +0000 2015	This #immunitychallenge looks cool and SAFE. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578351423219318800	Thu Mar 19 00:24:59 +0000 2015	I guess it pays not to eat meat. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578351008163594200	Thu Mar 19 00:23:20 +0000 2015	There's always one that wants to have a chicken for a pet. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578349771871539200	Thu Mar 19 00:18:25 +0000 2015	That's the first taste of defeat for the blue collars. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578349034659704800	Thu Mar 19 00:15:29 +0000 2015	It's amazing how many people play the game with major injuries. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578347664829333500	Thu Mar 19 00:10:03 +0000 2015	That HAD TO HURT! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578346877105483800	Thu Mar 19 00:06:55 +0000 2015	I love it when they start with a reward challenge. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578346293703020500	Thu Mar 19 00:04:36 +0000 2015	I still can't believe the blue collars haven't caught a single fish. What are they waiting for? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578345953700155400	Thu Mar 19 00:03:15 +0000 2015	That snake's going to make a nice meal. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
578345205620834300	Thu Mar 19 00:00:16 +0000 2015	I'm ready for 2 hours of #survivor. Are you?
576040632348586000	Thu Mar 12 15:22:43 +0000 2015	I've been eBay-ing wrong. I could've been donating to Rupert's Kids this whole time! http://t.co/JcH5zNUjQA
575823214313525250	Thu Mar 12 00:58:47 +0000 2015	Oooooh! Two hours next week... Will you join me? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575822465894502400	Thu Mar 12 00:55:48 +0000 2015	When @JeffProbst puts out your fire, that's a long, hard walk when you leave. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575822027111555100	Thu Mar 12 00:54:04 +0000 2015	Anyone who didn't see that coming at tonight's #tribalcouncil ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575820524804173800	Thu Mar 12 00:48:05 +0000 2015	The game is getting too easy. Wells, lots of food, immunity idols.... Geez! What is there to survive? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575817556746965000	Thu Mar 12 00:36:18 +0000 2015	Clothes in the barrel and more body parts covering holes will get more water in the bucket #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575817155582783500	Thu Mar 12 00:34:42 +0000 2015	That's just enough comfort to start a fight #BringOnTheDrama #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575816633551228900	Thu Mar 12 00:32:38 +0000 2015	FINALLY! It's time for the #ImmunityChallenge #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575816136907956200	Thu Mar 12 00:30:39 +0000 2015	I don't know if I've mentioned it lately, but I would LOVE to be the 1st player to play the game FIVE TIMES. (hint, hint) @Survivor_Tweet
575815597285589000	Thu Mar 12 00:28:31 +0000 2015	.@JadaHoyer I would LOVE to go back for a FIFTH time. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575815260789084160	Thu Mar 12 00:27:10 +0000 2015	What part of the #3Cs is throwing firewood? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575814662031282200	Thu Mar 12 00:24:48 +0000 2015	.@PhilNull There's no telling. Once the game is played, there's no going back. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575813794871513100	Thu Mar 12 00:21:21 +0000 2015	The game really changed when the focus became searching for immunity idols. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575812200281030660	Thu Mar 12 00:15:01 +0000 2015	Laura says that lizards make better pets than food. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575811134114127900	Thu Mar 12 00:10:47 +0000 2015	I can't believe none of the Blue Collars are going fishing!!!
#survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575810618084696060	Thu Mar 12 00:08:44 +0000 2015	Have you "liked" my new Facebook page? http://t.co/DxjXrOR3wL 
Don't worry, we still have the Rupert's Kids page too: http://t.co/9MfeUeTVzc
575809545525559300	Thu Mar 12 00:04:28 +0000 2015	Paranoia already? This is going to hurt your game... It's only Day 7. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575809292932149250	Thu Mar 12 00:03:28 +0000 2015	The answer (in front of your tribe) is always, "Yes, I trust you!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
575808363532955650	Wed Mar 11 23:59:46 +0000 2015	It's almost time for #SurvivorWorldsApart . Will you be watching w/ me? #Survivor
573300777504149500	Thu Mar 05 01:55:31 +0000 2015	Oh Feathers.
573300186509934600	Thu Mar 05 01:53:10 +0000 2015	She can hear something. She just laughed at what Will said and wasn't looking at him. #survivor
573299072750252000	Thu Mar 05 01:48:44 +0000 2015	The first time you are at tribal, and you dip your torch, it is one of the most exciting moments in life. #Survivor
573298895352143900	Thu Mar 05 01:48:02 +0000 2015	When you are cocky enough to think you are controlling the entire game, that is when it bites you!
573298258279321600	Thu Mar 05 01:45:30 +0000 2015	You don't vote your strength out. That is pure male ego. #survivor
573297703863656450	Thu Mar 05 01:43:18 +0000 2015	With 6 on a tribe, you need 4 to come together and that is tough! #Survivor
573296024653049860	Thu Mar 05 01:36:38 +0000 2015	You can tell by the music when the game is over.
573295886001954800	Thu Mar 05 01:36:05 +0000 2015	Jeff needs a lozenge!
573295067886186500	Thu Mar 05 01:32:50 +0000 2015	OK. I just got the look. Of course I would prefer if Laura was there... #survivor #Doghouse
573294883882078200	Thu Mar 05 01:32:06 +0000 2015	Man, challenges make me miss the game. I still want to play the game. Especially after that last exit. With or without Laura. #survivor
573294380242624500	Thu Mar 05 01:30:06 +0000 2015	What kind of spear is that? A sharp stick? #survivor
573293194680651800	Thu Mar 05 01:25:23 +0000 2015	I hope they come back with a challenge. They are my favorite part of the game. #Survivor
573292967286476800	Thu Mar 05 01:24:29 +0000 2015	You'd think he'd be good with coconuts.
573292669067259900	Thu Mar 05 01:23:18 +0000 2015	Vince's paranoia will alienate and destroy him! #Survivor
573291908623167500	Thu Mar 05 01:20:16 +0000 2015	Mike is taking on the worker role, and complaining about it. You can't whine about it! Shut up and do it! #survivor
573290320932302850	Thu Mar 05 01:13:58 +0000 2015	She is amazingly good at reading lips! #survivor
573290228905058300	Thu Mar 05 01:13:36 +0000 2015	#survivor brings out so many emotions!
573289689626632200	Thu Mar 05 01:11:27 +0000 2015	She isn't shy... That is for sure. #survivor
573289591630897150	Thu Mar 05 01:11:04 +0000 2015	But she is still wearing her bra! #survivor
573289196137414660	Thu Mar 05 01:09:30 +0000 2015	It can alienate him unless he can convince others to go naked. #SurvivorWorldsApart
573289045608034300	Thu Mar 05 01:08:54 +0000 2015	And there they go... #survivor
573288897641353200	Thu Mar 05 01:08:19 +0000 2015	It is good to see Max still has his clothes on! #Survivor
572414971147124740	Mon Mar 02 15:15:38 +0000 2015	Poster for a new movie I'm shooting later this year. What do you think? http://t.co/HCBjC0xgmw
571355467944988700	Fri Feb 27 17:05:33 +0000 2015	Thanks for the postcards @DavidHTroyer. Stay safe and thank you for all you do!
570772872475443200	Thu Feb 26 02:30:31 +0000 2015	It SUCKS being the first one voted off! ;P
570772307204972540	Thu Feb 26 02:28:17 +0000 2015	I do not have an early #Survivor. I think I am rooting for the #BlueCollar tribe with a slight edge over the #NoCollar tribe.
570771643531857900	Thu Feb 26 02:25:38 +0000 2015	Wow. I am shocked. #Survivor
570769397008044000	Thu Feb 26 02:16:43 +0000 2015	I knew she couldn't keep it a secret! #Survivor
570768400978350100	Thu Feb 26 02:12:45 +0000 2015	Foreshadowing...
570763886934171650	Thu Feb 26 01:54:49 +0000 2015	I LOVE to see #SurvivorWorldsApart trending. It proves @Survivor_Tweet is still the best show on TV. Kudos @JeffProbst @MarkBurnettTV
570763328286384100	Thu Feb 26 01:52:36 +0000 2015	Now let's see if Carolyn can keep her mouth shut about that. It is SO difficult to not share the news. #Survivor
570763087688503300	Thu Feb 26 01:51:39 +0000 2015	Thanks! @kennaboz23 RT @RupertBoneham is the best live tweeter, and is one of the reasons I still watch #Survivor.
570762116312887300	Thu Feb 26 01:47:47 +0000 2015	"Do you like-like him?!" Please check yes or no on this coconut." #Survivor
570761707766689800	Thu Feb 26 01:46:10 +0000 2015	By the way, if you go on #Survivor, please pack boxers.
570761583476891650	Thu Feb 26 01:45:40 +0000 2015	Apparently this woman is just coco-nuts for everyone. #Survivor
570761451784179700	Thu Feb 26 01:45:08 +0000 2015	Always comforting when a large man in his underpants has one leg up on the log next you and says, "You've got a friend in me." #Survivor
570761038062166000	Thu Feb 26 01:43:30 +0000 2015	At this point, you are starting to get hungry. You are sweaty and nasty. Politness is wearing off. Frustration is setting in. #Survivor
570759410907099140	Thu Feb 26 01:37:02 +0000 2015	She is falling out of her top left and right. Of course he is in love. #Coconuts #Survivor
570759119667224600	Thu Feb 26 01:35:52 +0000 2015	Already a romance brewing? They are coco-nuts for each other. #Survivor
570758892092653600	Thu Feb 26 01:34:58 +0000 2015	Weakness? No. Those are fluids leaving the body. #Survivor
570758670499213300	Thu Feb 26 01:34:05 +0000 2015	Seriously... EVERYONE knows you've got to cook your scorpions. #SurvivorWorldsApart
570756126070812700	Thu Feb 26 01:23:59 +0000 2015	Already calling him the devil... Evil Russell may have some competition. #Survivor #WorldsApart
570753044226314240	Thu Feb 26 01:11:44 +0000 2015	I don't like to follow rules, so I'd probably fit in "No Tribe." #Survivor - What tribe would you be on?
570752888407859200	Thu Feb 26 01:11:07 +0000 2015	Not sure what tribe I'd be on. I run a couple businesses. I do a lot of construction. But there IS the tie dye thing. #Survivor
570750693025255400	Thu Feb 26 01:02:23 +0000 2015	Every season of @Survivor_Tweet MUST have at least one #BigBeard. #Survivor

530173879843434500	Thu Nov 06 01:44:37 +0000 2014	In #Survivor it's sometimes best to just ignore things. Leave it alone.
530172533564121100	Thu Nov 06 01:39:16 +0000 2014	Congrats to Jeff Foxworthy for winning the first individual immunity. #Survivor #Keith
530170781506863100	Thu Nov 06 01:32:19 +0000 2014	That is a giant tribe.
530170531035635700	Thu Nov 06 01:31:19 +0000 2014	If EVERYONE gathered, not just her, they'd be in better shape. #Survivor

530168192253972500	Thu Nov 06 01:22:01 +0000 2014	It is such a huge advantage to have your mom with you in the game. #Survivor
530167678430765060	Thu Nov 06 01:19:59 +0000 2014	I was happy to have Laura with me in loser camp, but it would have been so fun to see her in a merge. #Survivor
530167508171366400	Thu Nov 06 01:19:18 +0000 2014	Where the hell did these guys get winter coats?! #Survivor
530167415380783100	Thu Nov 06 01:18:56 +0000 2014	That's a sin to use a Hawaiian sling for a crab. Catch some fish! #Survivor
530165971042832400	Thu Nov 06 01:13:12 +0000 2014	Whenever things fall into place that easily, beware. #Survivor
530165667798847500	Thu Nov 06 01:11:59 +0000 2014	It won't be blood vs water. It's going to be couples vs. singles. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
530164560326426600	Thu Nov 06 01:07:35 +0000 2014	Unless you have someone ready to give away an immunity idol to a villain then the merge wasn't so exciting. #Survivor
530164339689267200	Thu Nov 06 01:06:43 +0000 2014	Anything can happen and your game can get better again. #Survivor
530164258282029060	Thu Nov 06 01:06:23 +0000 2014	As a player, the merge is such an exciting time. If you're down, it's a time to regroup and swing other down players to your side. #survival
530164010797121540	Thu Nov 06 01:05:24 +0000 2014	Everyone is talking about a merge but it may not be what's planned... #Survivor
530163501092700160	Thu Nov 06 01:03:23 +0000 2014	Keith is primed for an attack of paranoia.

527620550898642940	Thu Oct 30 00:38:36 +0000 2014	A night of soaking, wet, cold rain. No food. Hours of sitting around. And the hunger. And then intense physical activity. #Survivor
527619582484160500	Thu Oct 30 00:34:45 +0000 2014	While you're in your house, it's easy to judge her rain reaction. But the rain beats you down physically and mentally. #survivor
527618437455966200	Thu Oct 30 00:30:12 +0000 2014	"I need this person to go before I go." - Yes, I think that's the point of the game.
527618247789527040	Thu Oct 30 00:29:27 +0000 2014	It is so easy to judge game play AFTER consequences are known. You have so much time for hindsight. It makes you crazy. #Survivor
527616552120496100	Thu Oct 30 00:22:43 +0000 2014	Hoosiers, join me for a VERY fun event Saturday: We are smashing and launching pumpkins at Waterman's Farm (Indy) https://t.co/htX057LMTX
527614634883551200	Thu Oct 30 00:15:06 +0000 2014	NOTHING is better than a #RewardChallenge with real food. I love meat on a stick! Your body is craving nutrients at this point in the game.
527613095624310800	Thu Oct 30 00:08:59 +0000 2014	Tomorow night Laura &amp; I will do a @reddit Ask Me Anything #Survivor #teamtiedye #IAmAonReddit #survivorsanjuandelsur http://t.co/nQJplHwbsb

525364758732873700	Thu Oct 23 19:14:53 +0000 2014	Looking forward to next week's Reddit #IAmA . We'll be using the u/TeamTieDye user name, since it will be both Laura and I.
525088345089900540	Thu Oct 23 00:56:31 +0000 2014	I don't believe it! Dad's gonna be hard to live with tonight. You thought he was bad about the rice... #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
525086710657744900	Thu Oct 23 00:50:02 +0000 2014	No matter what, Keith better not go out with a "souvenir." He needs to play that idol. #Survivor #tribalcouncil
525085390420840450	Thu Oct 23 00:44:47 +0000 2014	It's ALWAYS "scramble city" leading up to #tribalcouncil #Survivor
525084411822632960	Thu Oct 23 00:40:54 +0000 2014	I guess #hunaphu needs to get better at hunting and fishing quick. #Survivor
525083819389763600	Thu Oct 23 00:38:32 +0000 2014	WOW! They just cannot be stopped, no matter who is on their tribe. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur

525082329736544260	Thu Oct 23 00:32:37 +0000 2014	At the end of the 2nd week, you FINALLY start feeling "OK" in the game. #Survivor
525081686644883460	Thu Oct 23 00:30:04 +0000 2014	I remember them fighting over the TINY scrap of meat that attaches to a clam's shell. #Survivor
525081166731546600	Thu Oct 23 00:28:00 +0000 2014	Oh, Dale... The one less mouth might just be you! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
525081018261188600	Thu Oct 23 00:27:24 +0000 2014	Dale's lucky to have his daughter there, but he's probably not going to listen. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
525080652228468740	Thu Oct 23 00:25:57 +0000 2014	Food is always something that tribes will fight over. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur

525076690205016060	Thu Oct 23 00:10:13 +0000 2014	Even though it seems like a set up, every time I've dug my hand around and around. It ALWAYS works out for me. #survivorsanjuandelsur

522549553833054200	Thu Oct 16 00:48:16 +0000 2014	Everyone forgot about Keith again. It's amazing how that happens. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR #Survivor
522549373503168500	Thu Oct 16 00:47:33 +0000 2014	Drew is talking himself right out of this game. #Survivor
522548927866761200	Thu Oct 16 00:45:47 +0000 2014	The first time you have these talks before your first #tribalcouncil, you get SOOOOO paranoid. #survivor #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
522547892670586900	Thu Oct 16 00:41:40 +0000 2014	Everything changed for the Drake Tribe when we threw the challenge. It was the start of a slide. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
522547191458447360	Thu Oct 16 00:38:53 +0000 2014	The #kingpin might get a #blindside with that cocky attitude. #Survivor #tribalcouncil #survivorsanjuandelsur

522543398192812000	Thu Oct 16 00:23:49 +0000 2014	Drew is CRAZY to think that throwing the challenge will work out well. It NEVER does. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
522541472487190500	Thu Oct 16 00:16:10 +0000 2014	That is one heckuva reward. #survivor Comfort is nice, but it always causes drama at camp. #bloodvswater

520010568657166340	Thu Oct 09 00:39:15 +0000 2014	It is such a morale killer for a tribe that keeps losing. #immunitychallenge #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
520009540763267100	Thu Oct 09 00:35:10 +0000 2014	John's playing a great physical game. It will be his reputation and his social game that hold him back. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR

464205404491108350	Thu May 08 00:49:27 +0000 2014	Tony has to play an idol before the last four. You can't use it to get to the final three. #Survivor

459126482766295040	Thu Apr 24 00:27:38 +0000 2014	Everyone on this season of #Survivor is so likable. I wouldn't even qualify Tony as a villain.
459126077596921860	Thu Apr 24 00:26:01 +0000 2014	Big emotions and full bellies. That was a great reward. #Survivor

456596157427228700	Thu Apr 17 00:53:01 +0000 2014	Tasha is happy. She knows she isn't going home. #Survivor
456595162978738200	Thu Apr 17 00:49:04 +0000 2014	As a fan, I hate not knowing who is going home when we go to tribal. If you are a player, and you don't know, it is you. #Survivor
456594353557745660	Thu Apr 17 00:45:51 +0000 2014	That reminded me of when Coby and I were the last two Heroes, and were trying to figure out how to get the Villains to kill each other.

456592632769024000	Thu Apr 17 00:39:01 +0000 2014	I love a show with two challenges. A little soap opera, a little action, the fallout, a little action, more soap opera, then drama #Survivor
456592347791233000	Thu Apr 17 00:37:53 +0000 2014	If Tasha can make Tony lose it more, who knows what can happen.
456592072561020900	Thu Apr 17 00:36:47 +0000 2014	So... Will Spencer use his immunity idol tonight?
456591816670715900	Thu Apr 17 00:35:46 +0000 2014	I can't believe the brains got the wrong... Oh WAIT. Yes I can. And that Tony got it right. #Survivor

456589239367372800	Thu Apr 17 00:25:32 +0000 2014	I think there is still another idol out there and it has special powers. Maybe someone found it and hid the finding from cameraman #Survivor
456588866783170560	Thu Apr 17 00:24:03 +0000 2014	Those three are each Brains, Beauty, and Brawn. It would be interesting if one from each of the 3 tribes ended up at the finale. #Survivor

456587555798937600	Thu Apr 17 00:18:50 +0000 2014	LOL I like Woo.
456587072942252000	Thu Apr 17 00:16:55 +0000 2014	He should be working on his final three out of those six. Tony has the game in his hands, and he is going to lose it. #Survivor
456586885800816640	Thu Apr 17 00:16:11 +0000 2014	The best thing Rob, Amber, Jenna and I did was stay a solid four, and never broke ranks. If he were smart, he'd keep the six in line.
456586498100305900	Thu Apr 17 00:14:38 +0000 2014	It would be cool to see those three go on the reward challenge! I am not sure Tony and Spencer like each other even.

454055299435864060	Thu Apr 10 00:36:33 +0000 2014	This is a pain challenge. They are always metal challenges. It shows you who can go far in the game. #Survivor

443900965817974800	Thu Mar 13 00:06:52 +0000 2014	That was a very long segment of post-tribal council. They were probably up fighting for hours. #Survivor
443900364857671700	Thu Mar 13 00:04:28 +0000 2014	The hardest night in #Survivor is after Tribal. It makes you go crazy as you figure the new alliances.
441392434031775740	Thu Mar 06 01:58:51 +0000 2014	Nothing like going out with class. #Survivor

441388242995511300	Thu Mar 06 01:42:12 +0000 2014	It is amazing how clean they all still look... Maybe because this is the beauty tribe.
441387258080264200	Thu Mar 06 01:38:17 +0000 2014	I still have my Pearl Islands hammock. It is in the snake room. I was lounging in it the other day. #Survivor

441381409240776700	Thu Mar 06 01:15:03 +0000 2014	The rain cuts down on the treachery. There isn't time for shenanigans when you are cold, wet, and miserable. #Survivor
441381286490304500	Thu Mar 06 01:14:33 +0000 2014	They should change the episode title to, "Pretty Girls Sadly Sitting in the Rain." #survivor

441379500396261400	Thu Mar 06 01:07:27 +0000 2014	The rain will kill you. It beats you to death until it stops raining... And sometimes it doesn't stop raining.
441379375636676600	Thu Mar 06 01:06:58 +0000 2014	Both the brawn and beauty tribes haven't been tested in tribal. They have a strong bond. Until the rain. Now we will see them eat each other

441378680875413500	Thu Mar 06 01:04:12 +0000 2014	For the brains tribe, you'd think they'd use them! #Survivor
441378589636718600	Thu Mar 06 01:03:50 +0000 2014	They are already planning on how things happen when they lose the next challenge... Not winning it. #Survivor
438857269548433400	Thu Feb 27 02:05:01 +0000 2014	Wow.... Karma is a... well, you know.
438855226582642700	Thu Feb 27 01:56:54 +0000 2014	Just think... If you win and make it through the tribal, you get to go back and sleep in the rain. #Survivor

438850080679153660	Thu Feb 27 01:36:27 +0000 2014	I love seeing #Survivor in the top national twitter trends. After 28 seasons, it still generates so much excitement.
438848285269168100	Thu Feb 27 01:29:19 +0000 2014	They have a saw! What!? #survivor
438847746028875800	Thu Feb 27 01:27:10 +0000 2014	In #Survivor, being that tall is a disadvantage in the second half of the game. People think big = "he will beat me in challenges."

438844974247845900	Thu Feb 27 01:16:09 +0000 2014	Why do I feel like there is a lot of pixelation in Morgan's future?
438844267319279600	Thu Feb 27 01:13:21 +0000 2014	There is a Hawaiian sling right behind her! Oh my gosh!
438844117477752800	Thu Feb 27 01:12:45 +0000 2014	He had no problem making that decision for himself.
438843328231387140	Thu Feb 27 01:09:37 +0000 2014	Put in one tough guy in case you are going to have a challenge! #survivor
438842500611317760	Thu Feb 27 01:06:20 +0000 2014	At least they aren't throwing someone out in the first 5 minutes. #Survivor

324687163906211840	Thu Apr 18 00:53:46 +0000 2013	They stayed to their word, and Phillip is going home. #Survivor
324687053029793800	Thu Apr 18 00:53:20 +0000 2013	He didn't want to play it. #Survivor

324686108485103600	Thu Apr 18 00:49:35 +0000 2013	Wow... He is coming off arrogant, but he is trying to ensure those idols do not have to get played. #Survivor
324685888313503740	Thu Apr 18 00:48:42 +0000 2013	I don't think Malcolm shouldn't have played it that way. He should have let them throw their chips on the table first. #Survivor
324685487866540000	Thu Apr 18 00:47:07 +0000 2013	Totally understandable Phillip. #survivor
324685247298011140	Thu Apr 18 00:46:09 +0000 2013	If that is truly a second idol, Malcolm can change the game in a huge way tonight. What if both get played. #Survivor
324684716022312960	Thu Apr 18 00:44:03 +0000 2013	Let's speculate. Was that his idol, and he wanted to tip his hand? #Survivor
324684616344670200	Thu Apr 18 00:43:39 +0000 2013	I CANNOT believe how many idoles are in this game. #survivor
324684326073663500	Thu Apr 18 00:42:30 +0000 2013	Malcolm MIGHT think there is a 2nd idol, but they've never put a 2nd idol in to play after merge. #Survivor

322149070212837400	Thu Apr 11 00:48:18 +0000 2013	That hour before tribal council is the WORST. Think of the most nerve wracking, anxious moment in life and add starvation. #survivor
