# How does Rupbot work?

When Rupbot tweets, it picks one of three options.

1. Word level markov chain (order: 2).  Using [RiTaJS](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS/), Rupbot picks a random sequence of two starting words.  Until it reaches the end of a "sentence" it continues to ipck new words from its vocabulary based on their [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) of order 2 (also known as "bi-grams") probabilities.  For more about markov chains: http://shiffman.net/a2z/markov

2. Character level markov chain (order: 5).  Rupbot picks a random sequence of 5 characters from its vocabulary and generates new characters based on n-gram probabilities.  It stops at 140 characters. For more about markov chains: http://shiffman.net/a2z/markov

3. Context-Free Grammar.  Using the [Penn Tag Set](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) Rupbot has categorized all words in its vocabulary into "part of speech" lists.  Rupbot then can generate a sentence based a very simple English language grammar tree.  The specific grammar can be found in [cfg.js](https://github.com/shiffman/Rupert-Bot/blob/gh-pages/node/cfg.js) and it looks something like below.  For more about CFG: http://shiffman.net/a2z/cfg/
