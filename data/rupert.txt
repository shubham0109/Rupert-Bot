What a class act.
So glad #Survivor is back!
I picked someone to root for before the season started and they got voted out first.
Wow. They gave it to the Mom Squad.
I LOVE it when challenges are that close.
Tied votes are back in?
Everyone is so nice the first day of survivor.
Mike is already behind the 8 ball but he’s smart. He can turn that around on Joe because he’s a bully.
I now hate when they target the older since I’m now an older.
It’s going to take a while to learn these people’s names. Which one is Ashley?
I got creeped out when the parole office called his teammates “victims.” #Survivor
I wouldn’t eat your food the second you get to the island. 😂
I hope they didn’t leave anything floating in the ocean.
Collect anything that will float! Especially the red team!
You can make fire. Collect as much of that stuff as you can! #Survivor
Look at that blue water! No show has prettier photography than #Survivor
Wow! This looks just like the beginning of Pearl Islands! #Survivor
What a nice way to end.
There is some #survivor philosophy. "The we can turn upside down and turn into me."
It's amazing how many people win immunity when they need it.
An endurance challenge always gets a balance element so it doesn't last hours.
Survivor always puts you on a beautiful beach with a bunch of crazy people.
If your company wants to make a difference and send volunteers for special projects, please email us.
A special thanks to Call to Liberty for coming out and volunteering at Rupert's Kids today.
Having your loved one walk away and not being able to touch them is agony.
Survivor is physical, mental and emotional pain.
As a father, the father/daughter connection gets me. I would hear my daughter's voice in the middle of the night on the island. #Survivor
A day on Survivor is like a week. Thirty days away from home can seem like an eternity.
The crying already starts. This is always the most emotional episode of the season. Laura is already crying. #Survivor
That's a way to make a bond! The only thing better would have been to show it to her. #survivor
I am SHOCKED Brad has made it this long. #survivor
Anything interesting happen last week? #SurvivorGameChangers
Let's see if Tai has to use one of his immunity idols.
Easiest #Survivor ever.
I though the sugar shack was great, but this makes that look like nothing. #Survivor
One isn't good enough for you? #SurvivorGameChangers
It's always nice for the first few minutes, and then the game starts. #Survivor
That's ok. Debbie doesn't bond well with others anyways.
I wonder why they shuffle the tribes so often in the last few seasons? #SurvivorGameChangers
I don't know what we are going to win, but I want to win so please vote for me. 😂
That move just shows Sandra is the queen of @survivorcbs
Hey @robcesternino, text me. I want to see if I can recognize my own tweet.
I'll see you guys next week! Keep tweeting at me.
That's the most insane #tribalcouncil I've ever seen on Survivor.
Has @JeffProbst lost control of this #tribalcouncil?
Laura and I like that tribe. We are glad they won. #SurvivorGameChangers
Is this Double Dare from Nickelodeon? #SurvivorGameChangers
I think there will be two tribal councils tonight.
This is moving right along. Two challenges in the first twenty minutes. Maybe a third?
Winners will fight watching JT go after Sandra, but Sandra has been acting kind of cocky.
Someone explain what @robcesternino is doing to my tweets? #SurvivorGameChangers
Even Burton could catch a stingray. They lay on the ground and you shoot them in the head.
One more for Brad's ego. #SurvivorGameChangers
I wish I were out there playing again.
I love watching a season of Survivor where I feel like I know all of them immediately. Some of them I loved with!
I'm finally back! I am so glad to be back watching Survivor with you guys!
Merry Christmas!
I don't want to spoil it for the people on the west coast!
I think that was a bad move on the one guy's part. I honestly can't believe he voted that way. #Survivor
This is one of the most polite and civil final fours ever. Now it's time to stab each other in the back. #SurvivorFinale #TribalCouncil
Delicious. That's a lot of meat.
David is chopping up coconut popcorn as I'm eating real popcorn.
If it were up to me I would!
Yes, but Laura will not like that.
There are only two days I've never been able to play: days 38 and 39. Maybe one day.
Remember when Ken and David were on the outs thirty days ago?
Congratulations to my home town Kokomo for legalizing pinball this week. I remember playing them in 70's. I was a rebel.
Everyone gets so philosophical at the end of the game.
Hannah will finally be clean.
These super physical challenges right at the end really year a player apart. #survivorfinale
He leaves with honor and class. And it was hilarious. #Survivor
Hannah is just floating in there. Her name never really comes up.
When Big Tom got that bad, we made him go in the Ocean.
Hannah looks like pig pen. #survivor
How do they have rice left on day 36? They must have been given a ton. #SurvivorFinale
That's a great reward. Good looking good away from the tribe and strategy talk.
I remember when I took Amber with Jenna and I on a reward to convince her to turn on Rob. It didn't work. #Survivor #AllStars
This challenge looks like it hurts. Bloody knees and elbows on day 36 is rough. #Survivor
A reward where you're eating in front of the others is a blessing and a curse. #Survivor
Ken looks beat to hell. #survivorfinale
Does anyone else feel like there is less Christmas spirit this year? It doesn't seem like Christmas is in a few days.
Me too!
Dave was able to put the paperwork he got in there. You don't give the paperwork up when you use the idol at tribal. #survivorfinale
That is a first! A fake idol to just screw with someone.
If they are sleeping on the ground there must be no bugs. #SurvivorFinale
Being a contender doesn't mean you have to make a drastic move. Sandra won twice by not doing that. #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
Those little shells that they are collecting we called eyeballs. #Survivor
So much for hours. #Survivor
If they don't stay for hours, they aren't trying. #Survivor
Laura used to think it was cool when she came on family visits and then she got to play! #Survivor
Laura just looked at me and said "great memories." It's blessed us with so many. #Survivor
You can't imagine how secluded you feel playing the game. No phone. No contact with home for 30 days. Then bam. It's emotional. #survivor
I remember wanting Big Tom to pick Laura and I to go with him. He picked @BostonRob and his brother. I was so pissed. #Survivor
It's really making me squirm watching Ken stuck. #Survivor
Ken! You have to go on your back! Not your belly! #survivor
You'd think the smaller people would move through this quicker. #Survivor
I knew I was messed up during Heroes and Villains when Laura came out and I saw her face. I was gaunt and beat up. #survivor
How does @JeffProbst not manage to weep during the family visits? #Survivor
I'm not sure if Laura or the players on Survivor are crying more right now. #Survivor
I love watching this episode with Laura and remembering all the times she came to see me. #Survivor #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX #
You have to love the loved ones episode. #Survivor
It's great to be back. I missed you guys, and I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!
It's sad to see them go with the merge next week.
Oh my gosh!
It's funny to see David jump when Chris moved his buff on his head. He must not like showing he's bald.
There's a learning curve. You have to let someone stay there and learn how to do it. #Survivor
Jeff can make you so crazy by yelling in the middle of the challenge. It's needed to make the show better but it distracts the players.
Another cool challenge!
I like Michaela more and more but won't last that long with that mouth. #Survivor
THAT'S a reward.
I watched Sandra win the game twice by being the person no one needed to beat. #Survivor
Keep calm Chris! #Survivor
I hope the reward is better than a cookie!
Your feelings may get hurt on #Survivor but at least you're in the game!
Awww. Poor thing. It always sucks getting voted out of Survivor
Wow. There will really be some tears now. #survivor
The good thing about survivor is that the person that they start talking about is not the one that goes home. #survivor
Sometimes you get lucky when you need it the most. #Survivor
A learning curve on the balance will take a while. #Survivor
Another cool challenge!
Good Ken. Let's start playing the game. Break them up. #robandamber #Survivor
Ken is fishing. :) #Survivor
That was an early challenge! I love two challenges, even if you only win a cookie.
That's a new twist. Putting the puzzle together blindfolded. #Survivor
Nothing but a pile of sugar to make you feel better after now food for days. #Survivor
The girl has obviously never seen the game. #Survivor
Michaela got her place a little more solid with Jay. #survivor
And that's why people ask what it's like to hear that music in the jungle. #Survivor
Tears already? #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
It's a shame but Cece had to go. #survivor
That was a nice little exit speech. #Survivor
Wow!
Your millennials will try anything with anybody? That doesn't seem like something to brag about. #survivor
The obvious one never ends up going home! #Survivor
I am liking Chris more and more.
Four blankets and two pillows for eight people. Enough to fight over.
I'm having a tough time picking out a favorite. #Survivor
Where are the bites on their skin? #Survivor
David, There's a difference between superman and stupid, man. #Survivor
The only bad part about this is that we are giving up a challenge in this episode. #Survivor
It's not a merge. It's secrets! #Survivor
Ken should show his worth and go catch food! #Survivor
Paul looks like Sammy Hagar without the money. #survivor
This game will bring out your emotions for sure. #Survivor
The shuffling of the tribes might help a few of these people. Lol #Survivor
People don't like her and it won't help her talking like that. #Survivor
I wonder if tonight might be a merge? I can't think of anything else that might be a game changer
Nothing is worse than the blind side!
Survivor is a mean game. You never see it coming. #Survivor
Imagine that. The Millennials can't keep focused.
He's in the challenge? Wasn't he dying a minute ago? Gotta hand it to him.
Chopper or boat is on the way.
You're seeing why so many Survivors chop their fingers off with machetes.
Laura and I like Ken more and more.
Gosh I miss fishing there. It was so much fun. Try out just so you can fish.
Oooo they found pineapples.
FYI... There are condoms in the first aid box.
Try to hide your alliances.
You'll never be able to use a flint after banging it like that.  Lol
David was lucky his mouth didn't run him out of the game.
Laura and I are rooting for the Gen X tribe. She's a Gen Xer and I'm on the cusp of that and Baby Boomer.
I want one of those tribal masks for my wall.
Maybe they will make a Survivor with the first cast off. Haha
Going home first sucks.
She's going home soon.
He's a scared little rabbit.
When they aren't talking to you, they are talking about you.
This is an exciting #survivor because Laura has been able to stay awake past 9 PM.
Wow! The city kid made fire without a flint! #survivor
They got a night in a bed and a couple meals and then got to start over. #survivor
Wow. Survivor is the most beautifully shot show in TV.
If you see @JeffProbst outside of tribal or challenges, there's a problem.
Nothing like a night of hell to get you working.
My shelter was golden! After it filled up we were still dry because the beds were in the walls. We slept in it.
Now how much fun are they having? #survivor
You can't believe how quickly it gets dark out there. #survivor
They've spent just hours together. How is he already so trusting and paranoid?? #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
Paranoia is setting in! #Survivor
They made fire already?
Love seeing a Hoosier girl in Survivor! @hashtagfiggy
Jessica has 36 days to keep that advantage hidden. Good luck with that.
Ken is going to have one sweet beard soon! #Survivor
People in their twenties don't think about the future as much as fogeys do.
Jessica had a head on her shoulders! #Survivor
Take the fishing gear over chickens!
Who will win Survivor ?
I love fresh meat Newbies. Survivor
I can't stop smiling!
Nothing is more exciting than being on that island with @JeffProbst for the best game show on Earth: Survivor
Ok. One tweet. We like Cydney to win. She was our choice from the start. She's a bad ass woman! #SurvivorFinale
It has been a long week and I am going to spend the night watching the finale with Laura. I hope it's a good one!
It's always sad to see someone go. It's always heartbreaking when your torch gets snuffed.
If you think there is a lot of crying on this episode, then you should see what happens off camera.
It's good to see someone out hunting food.
Banging right through this episode. #survivor
There's a lot of back stabbing in this one.
It's crazy how emotional you get out there... But I don't know about that much man love.
Let's see is Jason and Tai can bond again.
I have never seen this challenge. This is very cool. #Survivor
THAT is a tan line.
Wow. Rain in a challenge. You don't see that often.
If they didn't see the grub as food, they are getting too much food. Of course the chicken ate that solid protein.
It looks like it will be a very exciting #survivor
Time for loyalty is done. It's time to play Survivor for yourself!
THAT was an exciting Survivor
Their skin looks so good. There must not be too many bugs there.
Scot does not seem happy.
I wait all week and it's almost done! Two tribals make it move quick.
Jason, you need to show that you're the perfect one to take to the end because you won't get a vote.
Yikes. You don't want to show you're strong at day 29!
Take your sweet time. No one seems in a hurry!
You can taste the end at 29 days.
That fourth time just didn't seem like it counted
Man, I would love to play again.
Don't get too cocky Sydney
Those showers are so nice. You didn't ask for permission. Nothing was stopping you.
Ok. Better than a glass of water and an umbrella.
Sweet. A challenge right away. Let's see if the challenge is worth anything. "Here's an umbrella."
Sydney's face shows she isn't with Thai.
I can't be mad at Thai. If he had given up the idol he would have gone home.
That was a very good #Survivor
Arrogant and cocky will always know you out.
The game never stops. If you're not talking to someone, they are talking about you.
Nicky has been cocky through the whole show and that's hard to live with.
I love this game and show. It's so mentally challenging too. You never know what can happen. #Survivor
I love Cydney's hat!
After three weeks, you start to smell. And I haven't seen them wash off in the ocean much.
I think Jeff hated that hug.
He's a huggy little fella.
This challenge seems like it's only been ten minutes. Man up! #Survivor
I never stepped down for food even when I knew I was safe. But Jeff would make me so mad. #Survivor
When I did this, my feet barely fit. The girls look like they were on two by fours.
If they don't go for at least five hours, they are weak. #Survivor
She has to keep calm and subtle or else you go home. #Survivor
I hope Sydney can keep control of herself.
They are showing Sydney a lot. I hope she isn't going home. Post merger, go after muscle.
No one ever talks about an all boy alliance. #Survivor
There's always crying in #Survivor. Laura said she lost track of the days she cried in Survivor. She claims it was because of me.
They just held on to Scott.
Scott has the advantage in every physical challenge.
Scott needs to sit the girl on the pole and run with it. #Survivor
These reward challenges aren't really rewarding. #Survivor
The big guy can't just put her on the poll and carry her!?
One of the reasons I never won an immunity challenge is that I'd win a reward challenge and be sluggish the next day. #survivor
Cool! A challenge! #SurvivorKaohRong #Survivor #BrainsBrawnBeauty #
Laura and I like Sydney. She's our pick. #Survivor
When watching Survivor do you prefer the evil villains or the less rotten ok guys? (No one is an angel on #survivor)
I wonder who showed him what leaves to eat. It's scary to sit and pick random leaves out there. #survivor
I've seen a man bun. I don't know what that is. #Survivor
I'm a big fan of the chicken this season. #Survivor
Ugh. Just give him antibiotics!
The cleaner spot was still outside with less brush.
I haven't seen anything as bad as what I had in Pearl Islands or All Stars.
You can trust a Dr. Rupert.
I hope a challenge is coming soon.
You don't spill your guts if you're trying to build an alliance! #Survivor
Michelle is a favorite of Laura and I. We haven't seen much of her. Makes me think she's made it far in the game. We hope so.
Debbie... I don't know what to say.
The best part of the merge is the food! #Survivor
So many annoying players...
A chicken isn't a pet. It's food.
It's a #Survivor curse. People get cocky on the island.
A boat AND a raft? It's like the #survivor yacht club.
I want to be the first player to do five seasons. I feel like this last one doesn't count because I let Laura play.
I personally would like to see Peter go home because of his arrogance.
Aww. I like all of those guys. I hate to see one of them go home. I bet they send home a beauty.
Scot is so tall he can almost run to the net.
Finally a good challenge! I love the action.
Take it from someone that has gone home because of cockiness... Cut it out.
Aww she's by herself all alone with her ant friends.
I like seeing the sweeter side of @ScotPollard31 on #survivor
He could pick him up with one hand and put him in the tree.
Laura says she agrees there is no need for exercise in #survivor
When you're showing off with pull-ups and calling yourself the mastermind, that cockiness bites you in the behind.
You don't need exercise on #survivor. Go get firewood instead.
I've been in these tribe shuffles. They can't be rigged. They are completely random. No one knows that happens and all are surprised.
There's a lot of hugging going on. Let's see how long that hugging goes on.
Hopefully it unifies the brawn tribe.
Sometimes it is so hard to keep your mouth shut.
It's going to be a fun few hours in camp. #survivor
Brains are struggling.
The Braun tribe doesn't even care if they lose immunity at this point. #Survivor
Lol I like Cydney.
Everyone cries in Survivor. I cried at least once every season. Especially my fourth trip with Laura! #Toosoon #survivor
Caleb, along with every other #survivor, wants to play again. Even if it almost kills you!
In #Survivor, you wouldn't believe how close to death you sometimes are. This is a very real game. Survivor
They sewed me up and bandaged broken bones. But if they call the chopper, you are done. What an emotional #Survivor.
There are possibly a hundred(s) of people on that island for the show and now you see why they need them. #survivor
A record number of shots of the camera crew.
How many people are going to fallout?
You can see their spine and bones. Skeletons. #survivor
It's hard to keep going when you know you're not going to win.  Survivor
#Survivor is STILL the toughest game show out there. It darn near killed me.
You've never had a snail so good! Especially with parsley and thyme.
That was a game changing vote. #Survivor
You push yourself till you're dead out there. #Survivor
Hopefully they feed him before they vote him out?
Laura said he looked pale.
Trying to concentrate so this thing doesn't hit you in the face and Jeff doesn't stop talking.
Where are the #Survivor helmets?
Why is it that the girls always think about a girl alliance, but boys never do. #Survivor
Spencer may help the girl alliance get Joe out and before you know it, he is next. #Survivor
That's what makes you so crazy. You think you know which way the game is going and then you realize you have no idea. #Survivor
Don't we all wish we had that type of relationship with our dad.
Laura says the dad is better looking than the son. But then again, she likes the rugged type.
When Laura came out on All Stars, the bugs ate her alive. Not sure if that had been a reward or punishment for her.
Even winning is set up to make someone feel really good and someone really bad in a reward challenge.
What a mean challenge. #Survivor
Those thirty days seem like an eternity when away from your family. It's hard to describe how much you miss them. #Survivor
There is always crying on Survivor.
No matter who you are, your momma always thinks you're an angel. #Survivor
Shout out to Big Mike, who is making some big changes health wise. We love you, man.
Only one person truly gets the redemption.
And a memorable exit.
One of the most exciting and unpredictable tribal counsels ever. Wow. #Survivor
Enough with the eye rolling.
In my first game, Pearl Islands, I went to my first tribal on day 21.
No one in Survivor is more dangerous than another. It just matter who has the trust of the group at the moment.
Those three girls looked like see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
Wow. I am impressed
Laura said she hopes this is something Joe is good at.
You gotta love Keith. He's trying not to make eye contact with anyone.
Winning is exciting until you realize you've slowed yourself down for tomorrow's immunity challenge with today's reward.
Part of what makes this good television are these small things that you might not notice.
Listening to Jeff will get you freaked out. It's a long challenge and you don't need to hurry as much as you think. I got but several times.
The reward hurts you after twenty days on no sugar and no caffeine. #Survivor
You think you know who you can trust in @Survivor_Tweet, but you don't. There are so many levels. #Survivor
She knew she would get some votes. Why is she leaving mad? #Survivor
It takes a loooong time to do tribal council. You can be sitting there for an hour while people vote and then they are tallied. #Survivor
Thirteen is a big tribe. It's very difficult to navigate within that.
When Jeff talks during the challenges, it is very distracting. It's great for the viewer, but adds another layer of challenge. #Survivor
Poor Stephen. Of course he is out first. #Survivor
I love how Keith is able to stay out of all of it.
We've been waiting on chaos Cass. Maybe she's finally been released.
It becomes a completely different game when the merge happens. Every alliance is put to the test. #Survivor
Savage just realized he's out of the loop. #Survivor
Too bad. I like him. #Survivor
This episode flew by!
People spill secrets at tribal without even knowing it. #Survivor
Someone lied in Survivor??
It's never just that easy. #Survivor
Tasha is tough. #Survivor
They'd eat it if they were more hungry. #Survivor
You have no idea how bad that smells. #Survivor
I bet that smells nice. Tastes like bacon. #Survivor
It's all protein. As long as you can keep it down you don't mind. This is making me hungry. #Survivor
Stephen is going to try too hard and end up having the tribe turn against him. #survivor
Strength is not Stephen's strong suit. That kind of talk scares him. #Survivor
You're really going to argue with Jeff Foxworthy on cooking in the woods? #Survivor
What a great shot of Savage in his testimonial. @Survivor_Tweet is the most beautifully shot show on TV.
I meant as in it isn't functional. My wife is sitting next to me. I'm not risking life and limb. Lol.
NEVER get too cocky in #Survivor
It's fried chicken. But it's jungle fried chicken. But it's a mental defeat if you're not eating it. #Survivor
Nothing like a string bikini in a challenge. #Survivor
LOL This is a fun challenge. #Survivor
I'll bet Chaos Cass will be nice this time. #Survivor
Always try to lose your buff as soon as they give you the new one so you can keep the old one. :)
Survivor makes you appreciate your family more. I was so glad to be able to take Laura. It made us a stronger couple.
Family emergency gives you chills. #survivor
A challenge in the first seven minutes of the game? I love it. #Survivor
This would have happened months ago so I hope everything is ok. #Survivor
Real life takes priority when you are faced with it in the game. There was zero question about what to do. #Survivor
It's never good when Jeff shows up to camp. That's a terrible way to leave, worrying the whole way home. #PrayersforDanny #Survivor
Take it from someone that has been voted out of #Survivor many times... It sucks.
#Survivor really needs to be on two hours a week.
That was a really exciting #Survivor
That is an outrageous #Blindside on #survivor. She's going to be so mad at loser camp.
Memories are short in #survivor
Where the hell did they find that watermelon?? #Survivor
She should go home for saying there is nothing wrong with going to tribal council. #Survivor
Joe definitely takes care of that tribe. #Survivor
Nothing like helping the other guy.
Laura just said she can't believe she played this silly game. She says it's surreal to watch it after playing it. #Survivor
Slingshots are always fun. I LOVE a two challenge episode! #Survivor
The hardest thing when fishing was doing it alone. Take off fish the spear, and sticking it on a vine tied to your waist. #Survivor
They all act as if they are alone for the first time.
No champagne with the OJ?
Enough comfort for one or two of you. #Survivor
We need a challenge. #Survivor
FairPlay and I had the same discussion when we played. They never stop writing your name down. #Survivor
Happy birthday to Abi!
I love Wednesdays! It's #Survivor time! Best night of the week.
It's nice to see someone that appreciates the experience. #Survivor
Savage grinned because they aren't focused on him. Sandra won on the "anyone but me" mantra. #Survivor
I miss Abi is the biggest lie on #Survivor since "My grandma died." #Survivor
I get it. I'm still mad at @JonnyFairplay for writing my name down twice. I can't wait to get him back. #Survivor
Wooooooow #SURVIVOR
This is a fun challenge to watch! #Survivor
Does Ciera sit out every other challenge? #Survivor
Did Joe shave his arm pits? #Survivor
Savage needs to do some serious bonding with his tribe, though. #survivor
When you have something like that in your camp, it is heaven. #Survivor
Should've played Joe! #survivor
Ok. You've got it. Now RUN! #Survivor
Joe... You chicken! #Survivor
I used the grill every day in Pearl Islands. #Survivor
It's like snipe hunting on #Survivor
Abi is Russell in female form. #Survivor
#Survivor
Jeez. There is a lot of crying tonight. #Survivor
Wow. Woo stood up. #Survivor
Wow. Abi should just shut her mouth. #Survivor
Everyone is lining up behind him. That's amazing. #Survivor
This challenge is made to hurt you! #survior
You just said someone is a train wreck. So you align with the train wreck? #Survivor makes you do dumb things.
You are SO CLOSE to others in every way during #Survivor that it makes you crazy.
While we are in commercial, please check out what we are doing at Rupert's Kids, my charity. #Survivor
I hope we come back to a kick ass challenge. #Survivor
I played with Andrew on Pearl Islands and he is a great guy. #survior
Keep it together savage! #survivor
Holy cow. They have a lot of food. #Survivor
Where did they get the netting from already? #Survivor
I hope the tribe is smart enough to keep Joe until the merge. #Survivor
Jeff is already playing both sides of the game. I wonder how long before he gets caught. #SurvivorCambodia #SurvivorSecondChance #Survivor
I am so excited for the new season of #survivor. It is still the best reality show on tv. And so glad to be tweeting with you. #Survivor
I love the views on #Survivor. They pick such beautiful locations.
I just cast my vote for Laura Boneham! #Survivor #TeamTieDye
It isn't me going home are the famous last words at Tribal Council. #Survivor
Does that mean Rodney is going home? #Survivor
People forget that was her promise for the tribe. #Surivivor
I can't believe Dan isn't pushing mama C for the white collar idol. #Survivor
Wait? Is that a drinking fountain?? #Survivor
Has this challenge even gone on for 5 minutes? #Survivor
It looks like something grabbed him! #Survivor
Worst day of his life and he is PLAYING #SURVIVOR!? #PityParty
Man this season is moving fast. #Survivor
It is easy to feel in charge with an idol in your pocket. #Survivor
Tyler has faith in Rodney? He is a good actor! #survivor
Foreshadowing: Beat the hornet's nest. #Survivor
Is psychotic one of the 3 Cs?
Then you get to play #Survivor!
How many would LOVE to spend their birthday playing #Survivor!? Love what you got!
What is worse than being picked last? Not being picked at all! #Survivor
What a nice reward! #Survivor
We are going to have an immunity and a reward challenge. #Survivor
Someone is bound to have their feelings hurt when there is a tribal council. #survivor
That was a pretty darn good episode of #Survivor.
Ohhh. I think they mind. Just wait till they get back to camp. #Survivor
Very rarely do you see clapping at a tribal council. #Surivivor
Things like this makes everyone in the jury smile a lot. They love the squirming and the drama. #Survivor
Hi Joe. We miss you. #Survivor
I think Dan just told Mike how to use his idol... #Survivor
The episode goes fast and there is more excitement with two challenges. #Survivor
If Mike gave his hidden idol to Shirin, then they could change the entire game. #Survivor
I hope this lasts for hours! #Survivor
Two immunities... See? #Survivor can be nice sometimes.
Sweet! Another challenge!
It is good to see them get back to a really cool reward. That is so fun to watch. #Survivor
You go home when you're too comfortable. #Survivor
Remember your three C's Rodney. Calm, Cool and Collected.
I really don't have a favorite player. I can't tell you who I am rooting for. It is like, "Who do you hate the least?" #Survivor
Loved that Challenge. #Survivor
At least the tribe of eaters will appreciate the award more.
Yikes... Did Dan break a collar bone?
How big of a flip can he do?? #Survivor
I don't feel sorry for either of them. Move on.
Jumping for joy. That is the happiest torch snuff I have seen in a long time. #Survivor
That was a very exciting #tribalcouncil
They aren't starving if they aren't eating the head. The cheeks are the sweetest part of that fish. #Survivor
Who else thinks Will is going to go insane at tribal? #Survivor
Mike is growing on Laura and I. #Survivor
With Joe gone, we will now see who emerges as the #Survivor tough guy.
It is just so exciting. #Survivor gets in your blood.
What a mean game. Why would I want to play this again? #IDo #Survivor
Sometimes you lose your mind in #Survivor. #WHOVOTEDFORME
Now you are just being mean... Coming from the guy that didn't get a letter from home. #Survivor
BTW, you don't have to wait until someone is stuck on an island to write a loved one a letter, and it will mean just as much. #Survivor
It is only an advantage if you can use it as an advantage. A double vote isn't that great of advantage. #SayAdvantageAgain #survivor
Wow... So much love on #Survivor right now.
Letters from home are absolute gold. #survivor
Nothing makes you more relaxed than a large man yelling "YOU BETTER RELAX" in your direction.
That is a good man! Most #Survivor players would not have done what he just did.
I would say that the one who needed the advantage won it, but they all need the advantage.
Oh the #Survivor drama. This game makes you insane.
It is amazing what you can convince people to believe. #FakeIdol
I have to say that I am pretty disappointed with the result of that tribal council. What a bummer. #Survivor
LOL
WWWWWWWOOOOOW! #Survivor
She is looking so longingly at a shower and a hot meal... #Survivor
This game makes you crazy!! #Survivor
It is so odd to see someone fight so hard in challenges because she wants to leave. #Survivor
An increase in music intensity always someone is dropping out.
If this challenge doesn't go an hour, I will be disappointed.
How to start a fight on #Survivor: Kill 50% of the chickens while half of the tribe is not there.
How many bribes can you sneak back for tribe-mates? #Survivor
She just articulated why most Survivors want to go back!
You can hear the skin screeching on the slide. Oof. #Survivor
I say this before he falls... This is Will's best challenge yet. I have gained a lot of respect for him. #Survivor
LOL
OUCH. #Survivor
I love an intricate and long challenge. You can mess up and still win the challenge. #Survivor
When someone wants to go home, you let them. Otherwise, they whine and cry all day long. And you get three more days! #survivor
Ugh. That is the worst walk of shame you'll ever take. #survivor
That is a giant tribe. #Survivor
He's athletic. He's smart. He is quick. Joe is a triple threat. #survivor
I love this time period in #survivor. At day 22, you're just getting into it.
Now who won the reward challenge? #survivor
It is always interesting to see someone tell everyone how to play the game, but they aren't doing much in the game. #Survivor
98% of the time someone says they "are just trying to be nice" they are actually just being a jerk. #Survivor
What is worse than everyone know you have an #ImmunityIdol? Everyone knowing you have an immunity idol and not having an immunity idol.
It is nice to see a player in the game... Someone that acts and thinks strategically, but doesn't act like a jerk. #survivor
Unless that soda contains an immunity idol. #survivor
Your body does not take the soda and beer well. #survivor
Your body does not take the soda and beer well. #survivor
THAT is why I like separating reward and immunity challenges. The action is doubled and more exciting! #survivor
I think Joe is the one to beat in this game. He has the potential to run the board on challenges. #Survivor
Poor Rodney. Jeff is ALWAYS the final word, though. #Survivor
I've won island pizza as a reward. It isn't the pizza you are used to. "Reward" is a strong word. Papa Johns doesn't deliver there #Survivor
Ooo, an early challenge! Maybe we get two this episode. #Survivor
I cannot believe how much food they still have after the merge! They still have a large spread. #Survivor
Nothing is sadder than leaving with an idol in your pocket... And no, you can't take them as souvenirs. #Survivor
As if this challenge wasn't tough enough... This cannot last much longer with the rain. #Survivor
This is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical challenge. Can you control your mind? Can you focus on something other than pain?
Wow. This is a tough one. Who has the upper hand? #Survivor
Excellent! A challenge!
I am not sure if you see the commercials I see, but "Mediterranean Tacos" made me laugh. #Arbys
She was a little too eager to pee on his leg. #Survivor
It's really too bad we as Hoosiers have to suffer for our government's faults. #RFRA #IndyWelcomesAll
Don't be an idiot in camp tonight either. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Instead of looking confused, be happy it wasn't you. #blindside #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Looks like more than one person felt that #blindside
Gosh! I miss playing the game #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
#worstsurvivormoveever
Could this #immunitychallenge be anymore painful to watch? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
You NEVER throw an #immunitychallenge #survivor101 #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
At least SOMEONE is out there fishing! #pelican #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
One of the best things about a #survivor reward is seeing something that hardly anyone else gets too #SurvivorWorldsApart #seaturtles
It's amazing how a reward can make things OK... For a little bit, anyway. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Guess that win came with a little #girlpower (and Will was there too) #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Imagine that... Will pulling the rear AGAIN #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
YES! Another early #RewardChallenge in this episode #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Hoping my friends in Oklahoma stay safe with all the tornado activity taking place tonight!
Are you getting ready for tonight's episode of #survivor ?#SurvivorWorldsApart Only about 10 minutes to get in front of a TV &amp; tweet w/ me
That was a classy exit. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That was a mouth-dropping #blindside #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
When there's not much difference in physicality, it's all about #camplife #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Any time you're that confident, you're done. Trust me. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
No matter how much planning you do before #tribalcouncil , it can all change in an instant. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
In a physical challenge, it's clear who's going to tribal with these new tribes. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's not what an apology looks like. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It really sucks when @JeffProbst tells you, "Got nothing for ya!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's one heckuva #reward ! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
YES! Another #RewardChallenge ! LOVE THAT! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Didn't think #tribalcouncil was going THAT way. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's so bittersweet for a #survivor fan to be at your first #tribalcouncil. UR lighting ur torch, but UR at tribal. #SurvivorWorldsApart
Is cocky one of the #3Cs ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
And now the game begins for the Blue Collar tribe. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The tide has REALLY turned for the Blue and No Collar tribes. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I want to root for Will, but he's gotta give me something to root for! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
This #immunitychallenge looks cool and SAFE. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I guess it pays not to eat meat. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
There's always one that wants to have a chicken for a pet. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's the first taste of defeat for the blue collars. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's amazing how many people play the game with major injuries. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That HAD TO HURT! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I love it when they start with a reward challenge. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I still can't believe the blue collars haven't caught a single fish. What are they waiting for? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That snake's going to make a nice meal. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I'm ready for 2 hours of #survivor. Are you?
Oooooh! Two hours next week... Will you join me? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
When @JeffProbst puts out your fire, that's a long, hard walk when you leave. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Anyone who didn't see that coming at tonight's #tribalcouncil ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The game is getting too easy. Wells, lots of food, immunity idols.... Geez! What is there to survive? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Clothes in the barrel and more body parts covering holes will get more water in the bucket #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's just enough comfort to start a fight #BringOnTheDrama #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
FINALLY! It's time for the #ImmunityChallenge #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I don't know if I've mentioned it lately, but I would LOVE to be the 1st player to play the game FIVE TIMES. (hint, hint) @Survivor_Tweet
.@JadaHoyer I would LOVE to go back for a FIFTH time. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
What part of the #3Cs is throwing firewood? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
.@PhilNull There's no telling. Once the game is played, there's no going back. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The game really changed when the focus became searching for immunity idols. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Laura says that lizards make better pets than food. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I can't believe none of the Blue Collars are going fishing!!!
Paranoia already? This is going to hurt your game... It's only Day 7. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The answer (in front of your tribe) is always, "Yes, I trust you!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's almost time for #SurvivorWorldsApart . Will you be watching w/ me? #Survivor
Oh Feathers.
She can hear something. She just laughed at what Will said and wasn't looking at him. #survivor
The first time you are at tribal, and you dip your torch, it is one of the most exciting moments in life. #Survivor
When you are cocky enough to think you are controlling the entire game, that is when it bites you!
You don't vote your strength out. That is pure male ego. #survivor
With 6 on a tribe, you need 4 to come together and that is tough! #Survivor
You can tell by the music when the game is over.
Jeff needs a lozenge!
OK. I just got the look. Of course I would prefer if Laura was there... #survivor #Doghouse
Man, challenges make me miss the game. I still want to play the game. Especially after that last exit. With or without Laura. #survivor
What kind of spear is that? A sharp stick? #survivor
I hope they come back with a challenge. They are my favorite part of the game. #Survivor
You'd think he'd be good with coconuts.
Vince's paranoia will alienate and destroy him! #Survivor
Mike is taking on the worker role, and complaining about it. You can't whine about it! Shut up and do it! #survivor
She is amazingly good at reading lips! #survivor
#survivor brings out so many emotions!
She isn't shy... That is for sure. #survivor
But she is still wearing her bra! #survivor
It can alienate him unless he can convince others to go naked. #SurvivorWorldsApart
And there they go... #survivor
It is good to see Max still has his clothes on! #Survivor
Thanks for the postcards @DavidHTroyer. Stay safe and thank you for all you do!
It SUCKS being the first one voted off! ;P
I do not have an early #Survivor. I think I am rooting for the #BlueCollar tribe with a slight edge over the #NoCollar tribe.
Wow. I am shocked. #Survivor
I knew she couldn't keep it a secret! #Survivor
Foreshadowing...
I LOVE to see #SurvivorWorldsApart trending. It proves @Survivor_Tweet is still the best show on TV. Kudos @JeffProbst @MarkBurnettTV
Now let's see if Carolyn can keep her mouth shut about that. It is SO difficult to not share the news. #Survivor
Do you like-like him?! Please check yes or no on this coconut." #Survivor
By the way, if you go on #Survivor, please pack boxers.
Apparently this woman is just coco-nuts for everyone. #Survivor
Always comforting when a large man in his underpants has one leg up on the log next you and says, "You've got a friend in me." #Survivor
At this point, you are starting to get hungry. You are sweaty and nasty. Politness is wearing off. Frustration is setting in. #Survivor
She is falling out of her top left and right. Of course he is in love. #Coconuts #Survivor
Already a romance brewing? They are coco-nuts for each other. #Survivor
Weakness? No. Those are fluids leaving the body. #Survivor
Seriously... EVERYONE knows you've got to cook your scorpions. #SurvivorWorldsApart
Already calling him the devil... Evil Russell may have some competition. #Survivor #WorldsApart
I don't like to follow rules, so I'd probably fit in "No Tribe." #Survivor - What tribe would you be on?
Not sure what tribe I'd be on. I run a couple businesses. I do a lot of construction. But there IS the tie dye thing. #Survivor
Every season of @Survivor_Tweet MUST have at least one #BigBeard. #Survivor
Tonight's the night! #survivor premieres at 8 pm Eastern on CBS. I'll be live-tweeting the episode. Will you join me?
Have you met the new #SurvivorWorldsApart cast yet?
#Survivor Worlds Apart will bring about some interesting interactions next season.
Looking forward to seeing what #Survivor Season 30 is all about. #survivorfinale
Congratulations! She played a heckuva game! #SoleSurvivor #survivorfinale
Minutes away from picking another $1000000 #SoleSurvivor winner! #survivorfinale
This has got to be the most gentle #FinalTribalCouncil I've ever seen! #survivorfinale
Natalie is going to be HARD. TO. BEAT. #survivorfinale #Final3
If Jaclyn wins the #finalimmunity, it's an amazing comeback #survivorfinale
This #finalimmunity challenge is a tough one, but these guys don't seem to have a sense of urgency #survivorfinale It's Day 38!
That was a heckuva #blindside and earned Natalie some votes from the jury. Biggest move? #survivorfinale
WOW! #survivorfinale
That win in the #immunityChallenge for Keith could mean that he could win this whole thing #survivorfinale
Keith has GOT TO be feeling good about this #immunityChallenge #survivorfinale
You know... If @JeffProbst called me RIGHT NOW, I could be ready to play tomorrow. ;-) #survivorfinale
That practice is really going to help Keith in the #immunitychallenge #survivorfinale
That's quite a #reward for Keith. Lots of power in sending someone to #exileisland AND getting the advantage #survivorfinale
. @JeffProbst loves that line. "That will leave a mark." :-) #survivorfinale
When they tell you to take as much rope as you think you'll need, you will probably need it all. #survivorfinale
I sure do miss sitting backstage, watching the #survivorfinale on the monitors and waiting to see who walks away with that big check.
There are always lots of tears on #survivor, but there are even more on #bloodvswater #survivorfinale
Someone is becoming a millionaire tonight!  #survivorfinale
Sad for Missy. Heroes&amp;Villains, 1st gosh darn day, I broke some toes! Medical is AWESOME!
There are some people that are happy in that council. And some that are ready to die! #Survivor
Even with all that she's not that likable. #Survivor
It is so easy to lose track of the game when you are in the game. #Survivor
God's finger knocked that off. #Survivor
You can tell them no! I set my own bones in the game. Stay! #Survivor
That looks like a torture device.  #Survivor
Laura and I were dreaming of that final couple spot and alone in camp! #sigh #Survivor #BloodvsWater
If they are smart, they can outline their six day strategy and stick together to the end. #Survivor
What are you doing?! #Survivor
Will tonight be the night Missy and Baylor have it out? #Survivor
I can't believe Natalie convinced John of that! #Survivor
Natalie is playing the game! #Survivor
Thanks for tweeting with me tonight! #Survivor night is a GREAT night. Missed you last week.
WOW! That's gonna shake some things up! #Survivor
You're so hungry that ANYTHING looks good to eat. #RatatTribalCouncil #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
You know, I'd love to play the game again, with or WITHOUT Laura ;-) #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
I can't help but like my fellow #oldman Keith. #Survivor
I was so HAPPY to be at Day 32 &amp; later, there were no tears. It was GREAT to be that close... #Survivor
Playing with a #lovedone can also give you a different perspective on things. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The way she's playing, Natalie could win this whole game. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Every decision you make gets more important as you get near the end. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur Did Natalie make the right one?
Do they get to keep the bed at camp after the reward? #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Tough challenge, but a heckuva reward! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
WOW! Everyone? #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The #silenttreatment might be their undoing. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
A good #boyfriend is always quick to apologize #jonandjaclyn #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Jon &amp; Jaclyn is a reverse @BostonRob &amp; Amber pair. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Think Jaclyn will make Jon clean up in the ocean? When you're out there, you don't realize how dirty you are. #survivorsanjuandelsur
Alec &amp; Reed need to start scrambling! #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
This #immunitychallenge looks TOUGH! #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Jon &amp; Jaclyn have been in the middle of the whole game. Until they are broken up, they will be in the middle #survivorsanjuandelsur
Not a bad bit of work #immunityidol #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Gotta have that #immunityidol once you play yours! You're a target, Jon. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
.@JeffProbst didn't mention the best part. A SHOWER and an indoor bathroom! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Missy is showing that the game is taking its toll on her. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Lots of revenge and anger comes out in #challenges like this one. #survivorsanjuandelsur
The overnight #RewardChallenge is awesome to play for #survivorsanjuandelsur
These challenges ALWAYS show the alliances for what they are. #survivorsanjuandelsur
As good as it is to play #survivor with a loved one, I wonder how bad it is to play with a loved one.. #survivorsanjuandelsur
It's #Survivor time! #survivorsanjuandelsur
Oh my gosh! With all the holiday craziness and family in town, I'm going to miss watching #survivor with you tonight.
WOW #survivor
Who has the longest toes? #SURVIVOR #immunitychallenege
Dang! A second challenge already? That means there are some fireworks ahead! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur #ImmunityIdol
Yacht? I think you mean a dingy! In All Stars, we had a yacht with three levels! #Survivor
I'm wondering if he might use it for Wes? #Survivor
What are they doing? That is a massive payback. #survivorsanjuandelsur #Survivor #RewardChallenge
Oh my Jacquelyn, what were you thinking? #Survivor
This looks like a really fun challenge! #Survivor
It doesn't look like there are any bugs out there this season. #Survivor
It's very difficult to not be emotional over a tribal council. #Survivor
Laura says you can't even trust yourself in #Survivor
Laura agrees. She just said #TribalCouncil is incredibly stressful. #Survivor
Ugh. As if tribal isn't bad enough, it's raining. #Survivor
When you talk too much at tribal, you become someone that isn't trusted. #Survivor
Will Jon side his wife or his game? Trust me, it's a long-term/short-term happiness decision! #Survivor
Keith is doing what Laura was sent home for... Telling someone they are going home. They have a day to turn it on him. #Survivor
The application to play #Survivor is now online. I am filling out mine! Are you filling out yours?
The entire game is changed every time the immunity necklace is placed around someone's neck. #Survivor
Mental challenges are so difficult when you're mind is fading because of the sun, lack of sleep, stress, and lack of food and water.
Jacquelyn is pretty confident in her ability to control Jon. #SurvivorCBS #Survivor
When you find that, the #ExileIsland doesn't seem so bad. #Survivor #SurvivorCBS
I've been on reward challenges where someone ate until they puked &amp; then came back and kept eating. Any guesses who? #TacoOverload #Survivor
Your mind says "Eat it all!" But once it hits your deteriorating body, it rebels. It's not pretty. #survivor @Survivor_Tweet
All they do is kiss in camp and he just blew her a kiss? #Survivor
There is a lot of muscle on that team. #Survivor
Just what your body needs when it's been starving and dehydrating for three weeks: alcohol. #Survivor #SurvivorTURNEDUP
Sweet challenge! @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
Right to a challenge! I love it. #Survivor
The posturing in #survivor is almost primal. #beatschest
They are fine until they break down as a couple! #Survivor #survivorwednesdays #survivorsanjuandelsur #BloodvsWater
I cannot believe how quickly #Survivor rolled around! These weeks are flying by.
I've never seen Jeff do a private tribal council. #Survivor
In #Survivor it's sometimes best to just ignore things. Leave it alone.
Congrats to Jeff Foxworthy for winning the first individual immunity. #Survivor #Keith
That is a giant tribe.
If EVERYONE gathered, not just her, they'd be in better shape. #Survivor
#TrailMixScandal is what? 10 nuts?
#TrailMixScandal
It is such a huge advantage to have your mom with you in the game. #Survivor
I was happy to have Laura with me in loser camp, but it would have been so fun to see her in a merge. #Survivor
Where the hell did these guys get winter coats?! #Survivor
That's a sin to use a Hawaiian sling for a crab. Catch some fish! #Survivor
Whenever things fall into place that easily, beware. #Survivor
It won't be blood vs water. It's going to be couples vs. singles. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Unless you have someone ready to give away an immunity idol to a villain then the merge wasn't so exciting. #Survivor
Anything can happen and your game can get better again. #Survivor
As a player, the merge is such an exciting time. If you're down, it's a time to regroup and swing other down players to your side. #survival
Everyone is talking about a merge but it may not be what's planned... #Survivor
Keith is primed for an attack of paranoia.
Who's excited about #survivorsanjuandelsur tonight? Will you be tweeting along at 8?
A night of soaking, wet, cold rain. No food. Hours of sitting around. And the hunger. And then intense physical activity. #Survivor
While you're in your house, it's easy to judge her rain reaction. But the rain beats you down physically and mentally. #survivor
I need this person to go before I go. - Yes, I think that's the point of the game.
It is so easy to judge game play AFTER consequences are known. You have so much time for hindsight. It makes you crazy. #Survivor
NOTHING is better than a #RewardChallenge with real food. I love meat on a stick! Your body is craving nutrients at this point in the game.
Very clever, sneaky game play. #Survivor
Looking forward to next week's Reddit #IAmA . We'll be using the u/TeamTieDye user name, since it will be both Laura and I.
I don't believe it! Dad's gonna be hard to live with tonight. You thought he was bad about the rice... #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
No matter what, Keith better not go out with a "souvenir." He needs to play that idol. #Survivor #tribalcouncil
It's ALWAYS "scramble city" leading up to #tribalcouncil #Survivor
I guess #hunaphu needs to get better at hunting and fishing quick. #Survivor
WOW! They just cannot be stopped, no matter who is on their tribe. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
I've gotten a little muddy playing the game... #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
At the end of the 2nd week, you FINALLY start feeling "OK" in the game. #Survivor
I remember them fighting over the TINY scrap of meat that attaches to a clam's shell. #Survivor
Oh, Dale... The one less mouth might just be you! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Dale's lucky to have his daughter there, but he's probably not going to listen. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Food is always something that tribes will fight over. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
I wish Laura and I would have made it to the point of playing together in #BloodVsWater #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Even though it seems like a set up, every time I've dug my hand around and around. It ALWAYS works out for me. #survivorsanjuandelsur
Drop your buffs? Anyone think this was happening tonight? #survivorsanjuandelsur
Thanks to all the folks who showed up tonight to watch #Survivor w/ us at @TeddysBgrJoint ! Great times w/ a great crowd.
Looking forward to visiting @IndyStyle in the morning to talk about Rupert's Kids' TENTH Annual Tuxes &amp; Tennies. Will you be watching?
It's amazing how often that seems to happen on #Survivor #karma
Everyone forgot about Keith again. It's amazing how that happens. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR #Survivor
Drew is talking himself right out of this game. #Survivor
The first time you have these talks before your first #tribalcouncil, you get SOOOOO paranoid. #survivor #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Everything changed for the Drake Tribe when we threw the challenge. It was the start of a slide. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The #kingpin might get a #blindside with that cocky attitude. #Survivor #tribalcouncil #survivorsanjuandelsur
I used to dream of swimming challenges. #Immunitychallenge #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
It's amazing how all these twists and turns can turn your game around #immunityidol #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Drew is CRAZY to think that throwing the challenge will work out well. It NEVER does. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
That is one heckuva reward. #survivor Comfort is nice, but it always causes drama at camp. #bloodvswater
They should've never traded the flint in the first place! #Survivor
Drew certainly has a different perception of his game. Your true colors always show. #Survivor
They're gonna be so sorry they got rid of John when they have a physical challenge... #Survivor
Any predictions for tonight's #survivorsanjuandelsur ?
It's almost time for tonight's episode of #survivorsanjuandelsur . Will you be watching with me tonight? #TeamTieDye
Watching tonight REALLY makes me want to play #Survivor again.
Did not see that!! WOW! I think it's gonna hurt them. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR #blindside
.@JeffProbst is right... #TribalCouncil is always a little CRAZY #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It might be a little early to take out "the biggest threat" #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It is such a morale killer for a tribe that keeps losing. #immunitychallenge #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
John's playing a great physical game. It will be his reputation and his social game that hold him back. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
They aren't very covert with their scheming, are they? #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
You'd be surprised how good those snails taste when you're that hungry. I've eaten many of those snails... #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
What did Julie THINK was going to happen when she left to play this game w/ John? #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
That was a missed opportunity by Wes to go to #ExileIsland himself #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Pulling for dad! At our age, we know the eyes and the balance are quick to go. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
TWO REWARDS!! #Survivor
It never ends well for someone who sleeps when everyone else is working. Everyone thinks you're lazy. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It's amazing how the guys bond together... For some reason, the girls find it hard to work w/ each other. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Josh has the potential to be very strong in his tribe... Let's see how well he does tonight. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It's almost time for tonight's episode of #survivorsanjuandelsur. Will you be around to live tweet with me? #survivor
Any predictions about tomorrow night's episode of #survivorsanjuandelsur #survivor ?
This looks like it could be a #survivor immunity necklace. #Repost from @ilovetocreate
There is always crazy talk at tribal counsel. It drives you crazy! #Survivor
Alright, that was fun to watch. #ClashOfTheOldGuys #Survivor
I loved this challenge when I battled Coach. It helped me release a little hostility towards him at the time. #Survivor
This challenges beats the heck out of you. #Survivor
Maybe there is an idol buried close to their camp and it isn't the thing tied to the well... Hmmm... Thoughts? #Survivor
I'd tell them that I'd build a roof over the fire. Don't give up the fishing gear! #Survivor
If you love him, you'll go to exile island! #Survivor #Cmon!
These challenges in the arena look big, but that is a tight area and it favors smaller people. #survivor
When all you're trying to do is focus, I'm not sure how helpful it is when someone is yelling "STAY FOCUSED!" #Survivor
Despite the "pets," Laura just said she'd play in a heartbeat. It gets in your blood. The game. Not the parasites. #Survivor
You can't truly understand how hard being voted out as number 1 can be until it happens to you.
Where did the Baylor vote come from? Who is that out of the loop?
How does Jeff learn their name so quickly? I can't name one person after this episode. #Survivor
Welcome to the sad tribe. #Survivor
Maybe there are pumas on the island... But there are definitely a few cougars. #Survivor
#Survivor is hard, and the toll of the game can last long after you return home. @Survivor_Tweet
It's been over a year since we played #BloodvsWater, and Laura is finally getting rid of the pets she brought home. #parasites
Laura just said that I talk too much during #Survivor now. I used to not let anyone talk. But it's ok. I'll watch it again tonight.
One of the smallest things in #Survivor that can kill you are the smallest things: the bugs. And we aren't seeing a lot of bugs.
When using the lens, focus on your finger till it burns. Helps find the focal point. #Survivor #SurvivalTip
It looks like there is going to be a lot of crying this season. #Survivor
I am a fan of making the first twist a reward and NOT an elimination. #Survivor
It is so easy to talk tough on day one. #Survivor
It's day one. So all that before now did not even count! #BloodVsWater #Survivor #SurvivorPremiere
Did they REALLY just yell "We need help!"? #SurvivorPremiere #Survivor
Hey, where did they get flint and steel?#NoFair #SurvivorPremiere #Survivor
If you're going on #Survivor, wouldn't you learn how to start a fire? #SurvivorPremiere
Give that daughter five days, and she will vote her mom out. #Survivor #SurvivorPremiere
Before you ask, you're darn right we want another chance together. #bloodvswater #SurvivorPremiere #Survivor
Laura and I are excited that #BloodVsWater is beginning again. It is a great season last time. With one exception. #Survivor
#survivorsanjuandelsur starts in 3 days. What are you doing Wednesday night for a new #bloodvswater season of #Survivor?
Happy anniversary to my wonderful wife Laura! Today was great!
Do you like the all new cast for this season's #Survivor Blood vs. Water? Or do you prefer 1/2 returning, 1/2 new? #SurvivorSanJuanDelSur
At this point in the game, the pain is so real. You can't see the level of misery on TV. #Survivor
Tony has to play an idol before the last four. You can't use it to get to the final three. #Survivor
I am sure Tony is actually a really good guy in person, but he is "#Survivor Crazy." It makes you do things you wouldn't normally.
Tony could sit calmly and quietly and end up in the final three. I do not understand why he is talking. #Survivor
I will be on @HSN on the 14th of this month showing off @iLoveToCreate Tulip One-Step Tie-Dye Kit at 1 AM and 4 PM EST, so set your DVR!
My final 4 predictions - Spencer, Tony, Tasha, and Kass (because she is sneaky and Wu is nice.) #Survivor
Good for you, man. The brains tribe is still kicking butt. #Survivor
I think Tasha HAS to get this one, and is probably the only one that can. #Survivor
Why is Tony worried when he has a special idol? When he votes someone, they are heading home. #Survivor
I still believe that is Tasha makes it to the end, she will win. #Survivor
EVERY TIME three people are alone in this game, those three will be the final three. #Survivor
If Spencer and Tasha can stick together, they can be in the final two. #Survivor
Tony is GREAT at stirring the pot. He has turned out to be a great player. #Survivor
Maybe Spencer has a magic idol?
Good for her! #Survivor
This is a great equalizing game for this crowd. Not balance/strength/etc... #Survivor
If he wins immunity... I WILL go insane. #Survivor
Can he wave that in Spencer's face any more? #Survivor
How many advantages can Tony get? #Survivor
I've been team Tasha from the beginning, but I have to side with Spencer here.
Someone say $500!
Protein is what your body truly needs when you are on the island. That moment is as good as any earthly pleasure. #Survivor
That rice is more nutritious than the ridiculous candy. #survivor
NO nutritional value at all. #Survivor
I cannot believe some of the silly things they waste the money on. #Survivor
Some already have their letter, so they can buy food. But if I didn't have the letter, I'd save it.
I LOVE auction day! It is always one of the more exciting episodes. #Survivor
How lucky can you get? #Survivor
Fleeing to the #SpyShack #Survivor
Man, it has to be tough to balance your balls that high. #Survivor #Sorry
Jeff is great at telling people where to put their balls. #Survivor
There is no way I could do that. #Survivor
Everyone on this season of #Survivor is so likable. I wouldn't even qualify Tony as a villain.
Big emotions and full bellies. That was a great reward. #Survivor
A good episode of @Survivor_Tweet has some crying. #Survivor
That is a GREAT surprise. The others will be so crushed. #Survivor
Man does that look good! And I have eaten today... #Survivor
Did you break your butt? LOL
How great is it that Tony gets to sit alone with the people betrayed, while Spencer and Tasha have some alone time. #Survivor
See? #Survivor
He is tough enough to pull himself in the boat. The puzzle is the equalizer here. #Survivor
Tasha and Spencer are tough to beat together!
Spencer and Tasha are on the same team. I hope there is a puzzle. #Survivor
What did Tony expect when he went against his alliance? #Survivor
Spencer and Tasha need to get it together, and own this game. #Survivor
WOW, what a hiding spot. #survivor
OH MY GOSH! I can not believe that, and neither can they! #Survivor
Tasha is happy. She knows she isn't going home. #Survivor
As a fan, I hate not knowing who is going home when we go to tribal. If you are a player, and you don't know, it is you. #Survivor
That reminded me of when Coby and I were the last two Heroes, and were trying to figure out how to get the Villains to kill each other.
Mmmm, boiled clothes soup.
I love a show with two challenges. A little soap opera, a little action, the fallout, a little action, more soap opera, then drama #Survivor
If Tasha can make Tony lose it more, who knows what can happen.
So... Will Spencer use his immunity idol tonight?
I can't believe the brains got the wrong... Oh WAIT. Yes I can. And that Tony got it right. #Survivor
If it is a popularity challenge, it will REALLY turn up the the on Tony's paranoia. #Survivor
Keep trying Josh #Survivor
I think there is still another idol out there and it has special powers. Maybe someone found it and hid the finding from cameraman #Survivor
Those three are each Brains, Beauty, and Brawn. It would be interesting if one from each of the 3 tribes ended up at the finale. #Survivor
When you are at camp starving, and someone is eating a big reward meal... YOU'RE PISSED! #Survivor
LOL I like Woo.
He should be working on his final three out of those six. Tony has the game in his hands, and he is going to lose it. #Survivor
The best thing Rob, Amber, Jenna and I did was stay a solid four, and never broke ranks. If he were smart, he'd keep the six in line.
It would be cool to see those three go on the reward challenge! I am not sure Tony and Spencer like each other even.
#BeastMode #Survivor
You HAVE to let those things go when you are in the majority. @Survivor
THAT is what is going to start the paranoia! #survivor
Oh dear. Shhhhhhhhhhhhh #survivor
Umm, the last time I was at an all-you-can-eat steak at Ponderosa, I at 17 steaks. But they were little @BriantheMost23 @Survivor_Tweet
Congrats to @Outback for making all of us hungry during tonight's @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
This has been a great episode of @Survivor_tweet, but I found myself thinking about how many steaks I'd eat during the break. #survivor
A LOT better than last week!
Two safe tribals puts him in the driver's seat.
For being a martial artist master, I figured he'd do a little better.
This is a pain challenge. They are always metal challenges. It shows you who can go far in the game. #Survivor
Yaaaay #survivor
Jeff said there was special power in the idol, and that is a normal idol... So is there another? #Survivor
If I was in my suit, underpants, or skirt those pants NEVER left my sight. #Survivor
When I put things in my pocket, they stay there. I wore zippered pockets on All Stars and Heroes and Villians. #Survivor
If you aren't following @mikeskupin, @monicaculpepper, @JeffProbst, and @Survivor_Tweet on Wednesdays, then what are you waiting on?
Can you BELIEVE he got that, and was smart enough to not share it?! #Survivor
That is heaven in the middle of the game. THAT is a true reward meal. So nourishing. Best steaks I've ever had. #Survivor
Who will be the one to find the hidden immunity??
Any time I won a steak reward, we would eat the steaks until they ran out. You could have more than one. #Survivor
Let's see if Spencer can use his brain to start flipping votes. #Survivor
Spencer is using his brain! It's starting to poke through. #survivor
#Survivor loves a good puzzle.
They play the game, but are treated like gold.
Those are extras faking in the challenge preview. They find a body double, and dress them the same. They are the "golden team."
I made sure the Morgan tribe had only the shoes on their feet! #survivor
Even though I am not crazy about Morgan, she is right. Kass has to go! #Survivor
How many pairs of shoes do they have!? #Survivor
Kass is a flip-flopper, and she is still at the bottom of the alliance!
That is a good attitude to have. I like seeing someone leave the show with class. Can't say I always have! #Survivor
They knew before tribal who had flipped. #Survivor
HA!
That exact attitude is why the brains tribe was ripped apart. #Survivor
I may not be on his side, but I always feel bad for those that go home with an idol. #Survivor
She is going to throw a wrench in everything. #Survivor
Uh oh... Someone thinks they are in control... That usually is a very bad sign for them. #Survivor
Barefoot or shoes in this challenge? Shoes make it hard to grip, but more comfortable flat. Woo has shoes, and isn't slipping. #survivor
If this doesn't last for hours, then they are not trying. #Survivor
There is A LOT of paranoia happening now. #survivor
Haven't they sworn on their badge a couple of times? #Survivor
The you should not have screamed "final five!" when there were 11 left!
With two idols in the game already, how many more can there be?! #Survivor
It is always "us vs. them." Sometimes you just aren't sure who "them" is.
Please follow the other #survivor from Kokomo, IN - @LindseyOgle28
But they used their brains. Finally. I am happy they did something right! #Survivor
The fact that Spencer was under consideration, the season should be #Survivor #BrawnBeautyDummies
My heart is beating so fast, and I am not even there. I love this game. #Survivor
How are they walking in without a plan? #Survivor #BrawnBeautyDummies
Bad decisions can cost you a million dollars. - @JeffProbst Kind of sad he has to explain the basics to them. #Survivor
I watched Sandra win two times with the "As long as it isn't me." philosophy. You can think it, just don't say it. #LoyaltytoNone #survivor
I watched Sandra win two times with the "As long as it isn't me." philosophy. You can think it, just don't say it. #LoyaltytoNone #survivor
It's nice to see that they haven't forgotten the rice
Well, that was painful and exciting at the same time. #Survivor #ILoveChallenges
If Cliff were beaten by Spencer, #GoHome. #Survivor Spencer did that almost single-handedly, though.
LOL! Was she pushing it out to sea!? #Survivor
The Brains are lucky to have Spencer.... But the way they play, they will send him home next. #Survivor
Empty handed? OMG the Brains tribe is KILLING themselves! #Survivor
NEVER throw a challenge! #Survivor
I am excited that we get to return to another challenge! #survivor
He knows he's in the jungle right? If you run up on someone, you'll scare them. He needs to calm down or he is in trouble. #Survivor
That is a beautiful lagoon! I can't believe they aren't pulling fish out of there. #Survivor
I am impressed they actually killed the chicken without fighting for it. #Survivor
So @mikeskupin thought the challenge was funny. THIS is funny. "Are chickens asexual?" #Survivor
How much food does J'Tia have to cost them before they get rid of her? #Survivor
When we one a chicken, we ate it AND the chicken feed. #Survivor
Now will beauty have the strength to kill a chicken? This ought to be good. #Survivor
Please follow the other #survivor from Kokomo, IN - @LindseyOgle28
Waist level? Really? Ouch.
Nice! Lindsey carried that bag by herself. #Survivor
Starting out with a reward challenge! I love it! It has been a while. #Survivor
That was a very long segment of post-tribal council. They were probably up fighting for hours. #Survivor
The hardest night in #Survivor is after Tribal. It makes you go crazy as you figure the new alliances.
Nothing like going out with class. #Survivor
#Survivor loves to blindfold people and make them walk in to things.
It is tough being the first one voted out of your tribe.
Alexis looks terrified. She might need a change of pants. #Survivor
Both of my Pythons are nearly 20 years old.
Inky and Miles. @KC6624
I, too, am at the butterfly stage of my life. #Survivor
After winning #Survivor, my two big burmese pythons got their own sunroom. Wally the Gator is in there as well. @briandalynj
It is amazing how clean they all still look... Maybe because this is the beauty tribe.
I still have my Pearl Islands hammock. It is in the snake room. I was lounging in it the other day. #Survivor
The brains came back! They can't believe it either! #Survivor
Lindsey's face says it all! It is great to win the immunity challenge! #Survivor
Laura and I played this challenge on Heroes and Villains! We almost won. #Survivor
I don't think you get to say anything about rice. #Survivor
At this point, I am worried about the brains tribe mastering a thinking challenge. #Survivor
Laura just said she is thankful it never rained when she was on the island. She is cold looking at this! #Survivor
The rain cuts down on the treachery. There isn't time for shenanigans when you are cold, wet, and miserable. #Survivor
They should change the episode title to, "Pretty Girls Sadly Sitting in the Rain." #survivor
The rain beats you down physically, mentally, emotionally, and if you have a soul, spiritually. #Survivor
In real life, you'd NEVER spend hours wishing you had won a tarp. #survivor
Awww.... that is the most pitiful; shelter ever... But they have fire. #Survivor
And it is still raining....
The rain will kill you. It beats you to death until it stops raining... And sometimes it doesn't stop raining.
Both the brawn and beauty tribes haven't been tested in tribal. They have a strong bond. Until the rain. Now we will see them eat each other
As soon as girl cop needs to throw boy cop under the bus, she will expose him as a liar, and that is all she wrote. #Survivor
If you are going to lie in this game, stick with it. #Survivor
For the brains tribe, you'd think they'd use them! #Survivor
They are already planning on how things happen when they lose the next challenge... Not winning it. #Survivor
Wow.... Karma is a... well, you know.
Just think... If you win and make it through the tribal, you get to go back and sleep in the rain. #Survivor
GREAT landscape shots. They are showing a ton of snakes this year. #survivor
The rain will mentally beat you down. #Survivor
Why would you get rid of Garrett and demolish your chances of winning challenges? #Survivor
I would have never guessed that beauty would win that....
Cliff didn't even need a ladder. #Survivor
I see how strength can help here. Same with brains... Not so much with beauty. #Survivor
I love seeing #Survivor in the top national twitter trends. After 28 seasons, it still generates so much excitement.
They have a saw! What!? #survivor
In #Survivor, being that tall is a disadvantage in the second half of the game. People think big = "he will beat me in challenges."
Newbies got the fire going! Impressive! #Survivor
The first day is the most exciting period of #Survivor, and everyone feels like they are going to win.
I hope Morgan finds an idol... Or a REALLY good excuse... I think most of the male audience would hate to see her go first. #Survivor
Why do I feel like there is a lot of pixelation in Morgan's future?
There is a Hawaiian sling right behind her! Oh my gosh!
He had no problem making that decision for himself.
Put in one tough guy in case you are going to have a challenge! #survivor
At least they aren't throwing someone out in the first 5 minutes. #Survivor
Contestant Lindsey, the hairstylist, is from my hometown, Kokomo, Indiana! #Survivor She is wearing Tie-dye! #TeamTiedye
Even though I love playing the game and enjoy seeing fan favorites, I am always excited to see new players. #Survivor
It is always amazing how people think they are going to be the winner before the game starts. It isn't easy to win.
#SURVIVOR!
LIVE Pearl Islands 10 year reunion today with @robcesternino at 8pm EST! I'll be broadcasting from @PunchBurger in Indy. Link to come later.
Today's the Blood vs. Water finale! Stay tuned for exclusive pics of the day's events...
Yes. If she switched, it would have meant she wouldn't have won. Now she has a chance. It depends on arguments. @8grahamcrackers
WOW #Survivor
Hope Tyson brought his idol. #Survivor
But... She was that easy to flip? lol #Survivor
Poor @monicaculpepper... #Survivor
They have to enjoy the reward in front of everyone... That is a great plan to make everyone hate you, and to drive them crazy! #Survivor
Wow, from dead last... If you have to win one immunity... This one is it. #Survivor
Watching #survivor with a group of friends!
A million dollars can REALLY make a person lose focus, and she has lost focus. #Survivor
When you are caught doing something in the middle of the jungle... You end up feeling really awkward. And it happens a lot. #Survivor
Watching this on TV makes me crazy. It is so emotional after playing with everyone, no matter how brief. #Survivor
Tina, you did da%$ good. #Survivor
#Survivor is hard enough. Bringing in the family element makes the game insane. The players insane...
What else is she going to say?! #Survivor
I wish this was my redemption challenge. I am REALLY good at tying things together. Not a challenge needing agility &amp; delicacy #NotDelicate
One thing about being too confident is that soon you become a sloppy player. #Survivor
They are starting to burn the furniture! #Survivor
I love her and gave her the chance to play... So vote for me. :) “@iheartcochran: @RupertBoneham Except for Laura B :)”
Personally, I think Rupert Boneham is the ONLY choice for fan favorite!! #Survivor
One week till the #Survivor #bloodvswater finale!
Tyson may be cocky, but he is controlling the game, and is going to the final 4 with an idol.  #Survivor
I bet Tyson is going to regret not playing that idol! #Survivor
They are doing everything but physically tearing her apart! This is one heckuva tug of war over Ciera! #Survivor
No one loves to stir the pot like @JeffProbst! #Survivor
You have to give it to Hayden... He is trying like heck, and is making sense. But I think he is in trouble. #Survivor
And now we see the split... 3 vs. 3. #Survivor
I feel like we haven't heard more than 10 words from Monica this season. #Survivor
It is SO hard to stick to a plan. I wondered how they can get to drawing a rock tonight, and now I see it. #Survivor
This time the hint actually is to an idol that is out there, up for grabs. #Survivor
Congratulations Tina. Hope it is a small ray of sunshine in a dark week. Hope you know you're loved out there and we are sorry for your loss
And there you go... #Survivor
Caleb just needs to stop right there. Leave it alone!
An underwhelming clap from the peanut gallery. #Survivor
Do I have any friends that can help me with the verification process?
I brought you in to this world, I can vote you out.  - Haydn, Good line. #Survivor
EVERYONE won on that reward. #Survivor
Also a VERY smart move by @monicaculpepper #Survivor
Way to go @monicaculpepper #Survivor
They had 6 knots on that rope, and they went down to 2? #Survivor #CMonMan
What a sweet daughter... You are happy your mom fell out? lol #Survivor
It is a tough challenge is Ciera kicks Haydn's butt. #survivorbloodvswater
If this doesn't last 5 hours, they aren't trying. The weak of mind go first. #Survivor
That snake got more air time this season than I did! #Survivor
Two tribal councils? Or longest tribal in #Survivor history? I missed what is going on.
He also said this season's first episode was voted their favorite first episode of @Survivor_Tweet of all time.
WOW! I am honored by something @JeffProbst shared. He said a focus group on @Survivor_Tweet voted me their fav #Survivor at 80%. 2nd was 12%
Tune in to the @bobandtom show as we speak to hear my buddy @JeffProbst!
I am not tweeting a lot. Pretty emotional episode, but I can't tell you how proud of Laura I am, and it was great to play the game with her.
If she can't win the game, this is a great time to go to loser camp. We will be together for the next 3 weeks.
Laura is TOUGH! Do not count her out! #Survivor
#TeamTieDye and Laura have a shot on #RedemptionIsland! #Survivor Do not ever count a Boneham out!
It kills me seeing those sad eyes. #Blindside #survivor
Of course I am proud of my wife! Now you see why I married her! #Survivor #Honor
It isn't good when you are talking, and everyone is looking down, and not in your eye. #Survivor
Ooooh, Sharks in the water. I loved hunting when the sharks were in the water.  #Survivor
These rewards sound SO GOOD on the island, but when you haven't eaten in days, sometimes they aren't rewards. #survivor
Nothing is more rewarding after a hot day of challenges than a giant vat of greasy fried chicken. #Reward? #Survivor
Booooooo #Survivor
Laura forgot! It is ALWAYS OK to vote out anyone but YOU! #Survivor
YEAH! Go Laura! #TeamTieDye #Survivor
After my first season, I never spent more than 20 or 30 minutes away from the tribe. #survivor
The more you stay away from your tribe, the easier it is to conspire against you. #Survivor
And excited claps from the audience.... #Enthusiasm #Survivor
Wow, it is nice they got some sharp machetes! #Survivor
Kat needs to focus. I lost because I wasn't able to focus. It's tough! #Survivor #survivorbloodvswater
Also, this is her technique to get him to do the dishes. #Survivor
Heck yes she's switch! #Survivor
Is he going to prove it? #Survivor
Brining loved ones in the mix makes playing #survivor so much harder.
I am so glad she made it through again! #Survivor #TeamTieDye
Katie has to take the glasses off. I didn't recognize her. #Survivor
The girl in the big black glasses  is this season's winner of the "Wait... Where did they come from?" award. #survivor
Laura is always working... Stay off the radar, and add to the tribe. Good strategy. #Survivor
I LOVE IT that Laura isn't on anyone's radar. #Survivor #TeamTieDye
If I did #UndercoverBoss, I'd have to dress like Gordon Gecko. #Survivor
If we say anything to anyone they put us back on the island. @McCadeP8 #Survivor
Ugh... Well, I hope she has been able to make a strong enough alliance. #Survivor
So close... #Survivor
You're still my hero Laura... #Survivor
So now Gervas can swim? He couldn't two weeks ago. #Survivor
Thank you! RT @timomcshade I liked the sand shelter.
Another swimming challenge? This isn't Blood vs. Water... It's just Water. #Survivor
What is he doing to that poor tree? #StopTheTorture #Survivor
That is one sad, little, pitiful shelter... I would be embarrassed by that. #Survivor
I am hoping this doesn't turn in to guys vs. girls. She is going to have to scramble to get in the women's alliance. #Teamtiedye #Survivor
Laura made that shirt specifically for this season. #Pirate #Survivor
I can tell Laura is so mad at this shuffle... She was in a good alliance. #Survivor
I am very proud! Damn proud! #teamtiedye #Survivor
I can breath! #Survivor
Tribal Council is one mean place. #Survivor
What did Tyson just say?! #Survivor
I am glad this show is turning the Laura up to 11... I love watching her on TV! #Survivor
Keeping my fingers crossed! #Survivor #TeamTieDye
Even @JeffProbst gets excited at the challenges. They are my favorite part of #Survivor
It would have been so cool to have a challenge with Laura. #Survivor #TeamTieDye
Too bad Vytas and Coach can't play together! #Survivor
Every game of #survivor (except this one), my skin has been on fire. The bugs are one of the hardest aspects of the game.
It is amazing how quickly the tide can turn, and you can lose all control of power... #Survivor #TeamTieDye
YESS!! #survivor #TeamTieDye
Go Laura! #TeamTieDye #Survivor
#RupertsLaw has a nice ring to it.
Rupert, which one is your wife? "The one in tie dye!" #Survivor
Monica should have brought the clue back to her tribe and have built goodwill. #survivor
#RedemptionIsland might turn in to the love shack. Will there finally be a #survivor baby?
That's how they greet each other and show their love? #Survivor
True story: I DID have a small lizard living in my beard during Heroes and Villains. Follow @RupertsBeard #Survivor
At least I don't have to worry about Laura going to Redemption Island for one more week. #Phew #TeamTieDye #Survivor
WOOOO! #TeamTieDye! #survivor
Darn... A challenge I would have loved and dominated! #Survivor
You know this episode needs? More Laura! #TeamTieDye #Survivor
At least I have company coming to Ponderosa that I actually like. #Rachel #Survivor
This damn game! #Survivor
Is this really happening? #Survivor
Still no regrets. I love the game of #Survivor but I love Laura more, and I am glad she is able to play. #TeamTieDye
People are nice to me first! I appreciate it.
I try to follow back people that follow me. It's only polite. So if I don't follow you yet, let me know!
I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that has tweeted us over the last week. Laura and I have greatly appreciated the kind words!
There was never one doubt. #Survivor
I would say this was one of the best seasons of #survivor ever. Great, fun season. #survivorfinale
Go Malcolm!
Rudy wins the "Things you shouldn't say on TV even at 85" award. Lol #survivor
Rudy looks amazing for 85 years old! #survivor #survivorfinale
And thank you to all of friends on here! You've made #survivor much more fun!
I have to go, but thanks to everyone for an awesome season of #survivor. I can't wait to do it next season!
Yes, they really do not know for that amount of time. #survivor
You do wait a long time because they have to edit the show. Each contestant has their own camera crew rolling 24/7. #survivor
That should tell you how many months pass between the last episode and the reunion. #survivor #survivorfinale
Love it that @BostonRob and Rudy are there! Cool! #survivorfinale #survivor
Congratulations @JohnMCochran!! Very cool. #survivorfinale #survivor
LOL "@ashton_tatka: @RupertBoneham @MariaYahm MARIA HE TWEETED US BACK!!!!!!”
Good move by Brenda, or uncomfortable? #survivor
Wow. This is getting crazy. #survivor #survivorfinale
Sherri, what are you thinking? #survivor
Erik is showing that bitterness you feel after you are on that jury. You are miserable.
Tell me how this is not entertaining? #survivor
Let the hair loose Malcolm! #survivor
#survivor: Will Smith edition
Cochran is a Harvard Law

Who will win player of the season? @Survivor_Tweet #survivorfinale #survivor
My money is on @JohnMCochran. He is well spoken and earned it. Sherri hasn't earner it, and Dawn has baggage. #survivorfinale #survivor
Sherri, you are in the final 4... Don't tell everyone you're a threat. #survivor
Don't you all think Brenda has shared what Dawn did with the jury? You are angry when you are on the jury. Dawn's crying gets old. #survivor
Eddie still has Andrea, Malcolm, Reynold, maybe Phillip. Maybe Sherri 2nd as fan. Then Dawn. So I'd want Dawn #survivor
Cochran is starting to dominate this game. Could you have that predicted it at the beginning of the season? #survivor #survivorfinale
These challenges are so big and beautiful. I just love it. This looks like so much fun. #survivorfinale #survivor
The tweet poll here shows that everyone feels worse for Erik over Brenda by a large margin. #survivor #notscientific
Fans love or dislike @PSheppardTV, but he is good on #survivor. Plain and simple. He's fun to watch.
Who do you feel more sorry for: Erik or Brenda? #survivorfinale #survivor
Say what you want about Phillip... He is great on #survivor #entertainment
#teambigbeard #survivor
Strength isn't just about how much you can lift... #survivor
Oh Shamar... Are you really a strong guy? His mind was not tough enough for the game. #survivor
The #survivorfinale moment when you say, Oh I remember them... And "Wow, that aired a long time ago."
My prediction is that Eddie is going to win. He has the votes on the jury. #survivor
They make them look like superheroes in the open. So cool. #survivor
Who's going to win?? #survivor
Death threats are unacceptable. If you would not say it to someone's face then do not tweet it. #survivor
This is a tv show and a fun game. This is not life or death and the person on the other end of twitter has feelings. Act grown. #survivor
I've been asked about Dawn deleting her account on twitter, and my response is the same as with Abi last year. #survivor
Happy Mother's Day to my sweet momma Georgette and to all of the mothers out there!
Eddie has Phillip, Reynold, Amanda, Malcolm, and possibly Sherri. It just takes 5. #Survivor
Brenda shouldn't have given Dawn her tooth back. #Survivor
I am now rooting for @SURVIVOReddie #Survivor
You people are disgusting. #Survivor
The easy vote is the smart vote! Look at the jury! #Survivor
Who is going home? @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
Sherri doesn't even come up! They are so blind... #PowerofShuttingUp #Survivor
If Eddie is in the final 3, he's going to win. #Survivor #Fans
You are seriously getting rid of Brenda for being nice? #Survivor
DO NOT Leave Sherri on that on that island to be the final 4 or 3 with a jury full of fans... #Survivor
Anyone vote for Phillip? #Survivor
We LOVE Malcolm and Cochran... But we are giving our votes to BIG BEARD! Go Matt! #Solidarity #Survivor
Hmmm, #15 Big Beard or #14 Malcom or #5 Cochran.... #survivor
Wow... Can I see that again...
That is the best thing Brenda could have done... Show Dawn is stronger than you.
I love challenges that force you to compete with yourself. #Survivo
Eddie and Sherri... Fans... Focus... #Survivor
I feel so bad for @meehand #survivor
Oh man... They have to watch and listen?! Ouch. #Survivor
I would ask Laura (my wife) if everyone could go. It is a great strategic move this late in the game. #Survivor
That is so mean... lol #Survivor
Oh, that is AWESOME! #survivor
He didn't say you HAVE to do it that way. Why not sit down and spin it. #Survivor
#Fatherhood is getting to @JeffProbst... :) #Survivor
HEY EVERYONE! Look how humble I am! #survivor
When I got it on Heroes and Villians, I tried calling home. Didn't work. #YouNeverKnow #survivor
It is SO GOOD to see the loved ones, even if it has been just a month. It feels like a lifetime in the pain. #Survivor
Less than a week left and he is losing it. #Survivor
The stickers go upwards... All those little needles HURT when you shimmy down. #Survivor
Go out and find food! Look at that ocean! It's full of food! Argh. #Survivor
It is so easy to get caught up in all of the silly planning. #survivor
Sherri is the same status as you Eddie! You can stay on if you turn the tribe on her! #Survivor
On body hair... They don't get razors. They sharpen clam shells on rocks to use as razors. #survivor
BOOM #survivor
WHO VOTED FOR ME!? WHO VOTED FOR ME?! #SURVIVOR
People ask what they are doing in the sand. They are bathing. You get in the ocean and scrub with sand to get clean and de-funked #Survivor
My replies are turning on Andrea because she is sneaky. Isn't that how you are supposed to play #Survivor
We are voting for Cochran! The girls may have won the challenge, but Cochran is using his mind this season. He didn't use anything last time
Ok everyone... Eddie or Andrea tonight? #Survivor
Eric, you couldn't carry two? #Survivor
Loved ones are probably coming next week, so you DO NOT want to lose this one. #Survivor
COOL challenge, @Survivor_Tweet! #Survivor
Some these challenges are so big! It can take days with an army of guys to build them. #Survivor
Look at Cochran! Big move spilling the beans. It should be Eddie, but I think it will be Andrea. #survivor
Andrea is going to end up pushing her way right out of this game. #Survivor
The favorites stuck together, so that is something, I guess. #Survivor
That is a fractured tribe. #Survivor
Paranoia will destroy you... But it doesn't mean they aren't out to get you! #Survivor
Malcom has pretty lady hair. lol #Survivor
Phillip with the hipster glasses. #Survivor
Tribal at 8:23? Maybe one long tribal? Or two? Got a lot of people with two shows left. #Survivor
If they vote out another favorite, they better be careful because there are still 3 fans. #Survivor
If I found an idol, finders keeps. What in the world was he thinking? #Survivor
Man, they are all looking REALLY skinny. At this point in the game, you've lost most of your fat. #Survivor
I would read it, rip it up, and throw it in the ocean right there. #survivor
They both showed they are forces in this game. #Survivor
Brenda, YOU PICKED THE LEG!! #Survivor
Two people on the same alliance that clearly do not trust each other... #Survivor
Bend the knees, squat, and get the center of gravity lower... #Survivor
So Cochran was putting all of the pressure on the women, and they have smaller feet and less weight, so they can win! #Survivor
I'd NEVER give up for food. Would you? #Survivor
Why aren't they in the middle and balancing? #Survivor
Eddie... You could have just lost the game! #survivor
They LOVE testing your feet in this game. Broken toes would be the worst... #Survivor
Another tribal the very next day... #Survivor That is tough mentally.
#Survivor has that effect on people.
Let's see how tough Cochran is! Eric and Cochran can control this game. #survivor
Poor Malcolm. I guess we are team Cochran. #Survivor
I cannot believe it. #Survivor
A strength challenge is my favorite. It is 90% mental. #survivor
Love letters are so valuable to your mental state in the game, even if it is a few words. #survivor
Twitter seems a little slow tonight. So let's do this. Who has a question? #survivor
Mmmm, that I might buy. #Survivor
Don't you want love letters!? But that chicken does look good! #Survivor
With the auction coming, that means the love letters are coming! I would bet it all for a letter from my wife and daughter! #Survivor
How many tie-dye t-shirts do I have? This many. #survivor
Because of the #survivor party, I have a friend helping type out my tweets tonight! So I may not get to answer all of your ?s right away.
That was probably the best tribal council ever. Do you agree? #Survivor @Survivor_Tweet
I AM going to miss Phillip... He is entertaining to watch! #survivor
They stayed to their word, and Phillip is going home. #Survivor
He didn't want to play it. #Survivor
Good.
I would play it! PLAY IT MALCOLM! #Survivor
Good grief... @Survivor_Tweet is showing why it is still the best show on TV. I cannot wait for the results. #Survivor
Wow... He is coming off arrogant, but he is trying to ensure those idols do not have to get played. #Survivor
I don't think Malcolm shouldn't have played it that way. He should have let them throw their chips on the table first. #Survivor
Totally understandable Phillip. #survivor
If that is truly a second idol, Malcolm can change the game in a huge way tonight. What if both get played. #Survivor
Let's speculate. Was that his idol, and he wanted to tip his hand? #Survivor
I CANNOT believe how many idoles are in this game. #survivor
Malcolm MIGHT think there is a 2nd idol, but they've never put a 2nd idol in to play after merge. #Survivor
When you get too cocky is when you run in to problems. #Survivor
#TeamMalcolm
We're voting for Reynold. Although we're team Malcolm in the Boneham household because he's doing back to back. #survivor
No, you don't get to keep the cool immunity necklaces. #survivor
I ALMOST won this challenge in Pearl Islands. I lost to Burton by a hair, and he gave me the immunity at tribal. #survivor
That is how secure he feels in his alliance... #Survivor
Fire ants, sand fleas, and other bugs... That's why I never slept in the sand! #Survivor
Poor @meehand The music tells us she's losing it. #survivor
Phillip... Gross... #Survivor
Not even close. #Survivor
Bad Luck Cochran: Second chance on survivor. Drowns in mud challenge. #Survivor
That optimistic musics says they WILL find that tooth! #Survivor
OK, I can understand that... I totally feel for her as someone with teeth issue! #Survivor
Man, that didn't take long... #Survivor
I LOVE to see Cochran using Phillip. #Survivor
They a teasing a Dawn meltdown. Hopefully that takes some heat off of Malcolm, since he has some explaining to do. #Survivor
I have a feeling next week, Andrea will be yelling at the tribe: "WHO VOTED  FOR ME?! WHO VOTED FOR ME?!" #Survivor
Malcolm has an idol, and he voted for Reynold... And he just took Reynold's idol. #INSANE #survivor WOW
Does Malcolm still have one in his pocket? #Survivor
Oh my gosh. #Survivor
I cannot even predict who is going home. #survivor
Why have a secret alliance if you tell everyone who is in the alliance? #Survivor
The hour after tribal council is even worse! #survivor
That hour before tribal council is the WORST. Think of the most nerve wracking, anxious moment in life and add starvation. #survivor
I think @meehand has a real shot at this in the end. #suvivor
Andrea needs to shut up and listen to Dawn... And Dawn might just need to shut up! Danger! Danger! #Survivor
Has anyone seen Brenda on the show until this week? #Survivor
How is Brenda not on there? But we're voting for Malcolm. #Survivor
Rick Ocasek of the Cars would have ruled at that challenge. #survivor
This shows you the most mentally tough players. This takes EVERY bit of discipline and focus you have. #Survivor
This is a challenge designed for people with small faces! #Survivor
These are mental challenges more than physical challenges! They are scary because you feel like you are drowning. #Survivor
I hope Malcolm plays the immunity idol tonight It's easy to get lost in the game and you lose focus on what's happning around you. #survivor
One day you feel great from a reward with a full belly, and it can take the fight out of you the next day. You pay for it. #survivor
Cochran is so pale. How is he not bright pink? But I guess you can always find shade in the jungle. #Survivor
A challenge in the first 8 minutes! Woo hoo! #survivor
The snake chasing the baby monkey might be a foreshadowing... #Survivor
I have been looking forward to #Survivor all week! I am interested to see if the favorites can bond back together.
Wanted to let you know, I read every mention and direct message. I get a lot during #survivor so I can't reply but I greatly appreciate you
Good for you Corinne. That's the way you've got to look at it. #Survivor
If Philip thought he was strong B4 he is going to be out of control now. I hope Malcolm can get back into favorite's alliance. #Survivor
If the favorites don't vote together in a block next I will be shocked #Survivor
If that didn't send a message through the favorites to keep in line, I don't know what will. #Survivor
WOW! #Survivor
12 people to vote. - that 's a long tribal council. Neither one of them #Survivor
Let's see what they are going to do... #Survivor
Why do they use Philip to go talk to the others? Why? #Survivor
We give our vote to Cochran, even though I like Dawn. She's going to have to step up her game more #Survivor
Cochran is opening up his eyes! #Survivor
If Philip gets greedy, they'll turn the vote against him. #Survivor
I hope Malcom doesn't get too cocky or evil #Survivor
Good for Cochran! #Survivor
I can't believe how good Cochran is  doing! #Survivor
Eddie was trying to shove it down with his fingers. That was dedication #Survivor
These are nasty. The worst thing that I ate was the jungle chicken eggs that were like these #Survivor
the less you chew the better off you are. Don't bite! #Survivor
Quit chewing and swallow! #Survivor
They've got pinchers #Survivor
Nasty food challenge! #Survivor
Good. First individual challenge for immunity! #Survivor
Philip is actually saying he may not win it - best way to succeed in the game. #Survivor
Dyslexia kicking in tonight. Apologies to all those I mispell. #Survivor
Pretty Close - I'm still waiting for that stand out player. #Survivor
Merge! and the favorites are strong! #Survivor
I guess Raymond has his idol pretty close to him. He didn't go running off #Survivor
It's not "Boat Mail" - it's a taxi!  #Survivor
Now, can Dawn actually stand up and do that? #Survivor
Stay strong Dawn. She could actually win this game! #Survivor
Unless Philip continues on with trying to manipulate the game (true or not) - it could be he who goes home #Survivor
Once the merge happens and it turns into an individual game, it will probably be time to get rid of strongest fans first #Survivor
Eddie might be left high and dry this week! #Survivor
Been lookin forward to this 1 all week. Looking 4ward to the merge #Survivor
I think Michael is going home. #survivor
If Phillip stays this week, my twitter feed will be filled with Abi-level hate next week. #survivor
Phillip thinks he's still playing with Boston Rob. #survivor
LOL! "The spy's basic tool is the grappling hook." What is this, Spy vs. Spy? #Survivor
Phillip has a confession. This ought to be good. #Survivor
I am voting for Reynold today! #Survivor
These challenges seem like minutes, but they can last hours! The jumpy music speeds things up. #Survivor
I hope Malcolm doesn't try to do too much too fast. It can really bite you in the rear. #Survivor
Women do not shave their armpits on the island. Some will use razor sharp clam shells to shear off their pit hair. #Survivor
Why does Phillip have zero armpit hair? #Survivor #Uhhhhh
You Tubby Lunch Box! #Survivor
It looks so good, but your body is NOT ready for that kind of food. It makes you sick out there. #Survivor
Bets on who throws it up first? #Survivor
LOL! They won on "strategy." The other side had PHILLIP on their team. #Survivor
Guys, cut him some slack. He has a weak lower body. Remember? #Survivor
Phillip gave himself a little ego boost. Just what he needs. #Survivor
Cool! A reward challenge. I love the challenges, especially the food rewards. #Survivor
Each Wednesday night I live tweet Survivor! Watch along with me!
Poor Matt. #Survivor
Red SUV? RT @shortstack08 Pretty sure @RupertBoneham cut me off in traffic today. #AllIsForgiven
Awww, Phillip unfollowed me. I guess I shouldn't called him wacky so many times. My bad, Phillip. #Survivor
So next week, the thing to look for is Phillip explaining how the strongest on the team stumbled in the challenge. #survivor
I hope Malcolm doesn't get too cocky. But I am rooting for him! #Survivor
#BeardSolidarity #Survivor
He had strength AND loyalty AND a killer beard. What were you thinking? #Survivor
Wow, all over the board.... Don't get rid of the beard! #Survivor
Do any of them have an idol? I forget. I think Reynold is the only one with the idol in the whole game. #Survivor
Here is the social side of the game: Just staying quiet while people implode, rant, and play the game poorly. #Survivor
People think he's the ring leader, but it just appears that way because the nice people don't speak up against the loud &amp; crazy #LifeLesson
Phillip... SHHHHHHH #Survivor
Who gets the vote? I voted for Malcolm. #Survivor
What? #Survivor
It's that part in the season when you start seeing people in the game that haven't had any screen time and you go, "Who is that?" #Survivor
We haven't seen Phillip make fire, but it looks he is about to fulfill Brandon's promise of burning the shelter down. #Survivor
In All Stars we shuffled in to a new camp part of the way through. It was great to see what new toys you had. #Survivor
If Eddie and Reynold can keep 4 strong, they will be in the finale. #Survivor
#DropYourBuffs #Survivor
While we are listening to little beard ramble, go like the Rupert's Kids facebook page for me. #Survivor https://t.co/flWEpICD2m
Challenge Time! Will Phillip rule the day again? #Survivor
#OperationThunderbolt #Survivor
Why are these people so unhappy? They all essentially got immunity, AND got rid of Brandon? #Survivor
Phillip doesn't realize it yet, but he is now the craziest person on the island! #Survivor
I am so interested to see who gets a second chance in the two new tribes. #Survivor
Way to go out Braveheart style... #survivor
From my time mentoring youth, I can tell Brandon is confused and misunderstood. He wants to be taken seriously. #survivor
First torch extinguished with a courtesy back rub. #survivor
I don't think we're getting a second challenge. #survivor
I am so glad they didn't put any of my meltdowns on TV. Well, except for WHO VOTED FOR ME?! #SURVIVOR
How could they NOT make Brandon one of the players of the week? #Survivor
Awww, honey, don't cry over spilled rice. #survivor
REALLY ominous music. #survivor
The freakout left me unsatisfied. The only thing can save it is when he picks up that rice… Come on… #survivor
I can't answer anymore tonight, but I will answer any new ones tomorrow.
Thanks everyone.
He's dead?
With the name RUPERT BONEHAM you don't think kids could come up with many things to tease me about?
I remember in third grade the constant teasing about my beard.
I'd have the State Police protecting me.
Samurai may not be in the budget.
I was a bouncer for years in a back alley bar.
I don't need protection.
I am all for midwives.
If you want to have your child at home, you should be able to.
To give a hospital $10,000 for the use of a room is a little extreme.
We should be able to choose how we live our lives.
I fully support the 9th and 10th Amendments.
I know what they mean, and as Governor, I will take my oath seriously.
Thank you so much!
I just spent a few hours talking to early voters, in the cold.
I appreciate everyone that gets involved.
Thank you for your support.
If I win this race, I will never go back.
If not, I can't say never but it is unlikely.
They prefer the bad guys over the good guys.
Fern make the best toilet paper.
It's like the Charmin of leaves.
I believe there is hope for marriage equality in Indiana.
As Governor, I will ensure that HJR-6 does not continue, and we revisit Indiana DOMA.
I will fight enshrining discrimination in our Constitution.
I am the ONLY candidate for Governor in Indiana EVER to pledge to fight for 100% marriage equality.
This is the last civil rights battle, and we are going to win.
It may not be immediately, but the louder your voice, the quicker things get better.
We are most definitely creatures of habit.
We do what is familiar.
Secondly, 70% of our population does not vote because they do not hear their voice represented.
As third parties grow, voter apathy will die, and so will the two party system.
Stephanie, is that you?
I can't wait to have my first press photo of me in tie-dye behind the desk in the Governor's office!
But I don't see myself running around in a tie-dye tank top much after I am governor.
But it will still be under a few layers!
It COULD reach 6 Billion!
With all of that money spent, do you feel more informed about your choices?
It's ridiculous that political parties are willing to spend such exorbitant amounts for a position that pays $400,000.
It's not the salary that they are after.
It's the power and control over trillions of dollars.
This money comes with strings attached.
We need honesty in politics, and we won't get it as long as we continue to vote in two parties that don't have you and I in their best interest.
In my race, I have spent a 300th of what my opponents have spent, and I hope to show that you can take the money out of the campaign, and still see success.
I am sorry I missed you too!
With just two days left, I can't stay anywhere for too long!
I had four events yesterday.
If you want to say hi, come out to our victory celebration on Tuesday night!
You didn't enjoy that extra hour of sleep today?
Thank you for your support!
I can't believe I am saying it, but I had a lot of fun in the debates!
I found it interesting though that the other two worked very hard... to not answer any questions!
As far as DST, it may be a silly notion, but everyone else is doing it!
It benefits our economy to hold to one time zone that is consistent with everyone else.
P.S.
I wouldn't jump off a bridge... :)
I have been fighting for our community for 20 years!
I don't give up.
I didn't in my mentoring program, in my small businesses, on Survivor, and now in politics.
I am here to stay!
Thank you.
We have to burn coal cleaner, and in the 21st century we have the technology to do so.
Indiana depends on coal, and we are not going to abandon coal.
The problem in our system is the cozy relationship between the power companies and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
We need a truly independent Governor to watch over the current deals in Indiana.
The Citizens Action Coalition has done a very good job of documenting the problems in Indiana.
We need to hold every citizen in Indiana to the same standards, no matter what your job or position may be.
When someone is breaking the law, they should be punished.
I don't think any Republican or Democrat would answer your question this way.
We need to start electing Libertarians to office, and create a fair and level playing field for all.
I was the only one in the debates that was willing to say, "Did we not learn from our past?"
I will repeal the Right To Work law.
The government should not have the power to dictate how workers deal with workers and vice versa when they aren't breaking the law.
RTW is an infringement on the free market.
Here is my press release: http://rupertforgovernor.com/component/content/article/34-video/93-rupert-on-rtw
The World's Smallest Political quiz is what woke me up to the fact that I am a Libertarian, and have been all of my life.
I just voted for Democrats, even though I wasn't satisfied with them.
Take the quiz:
And learn a little about the party.
I think our stances on things like criminal justice reform, civil liberties, education, and anti-war issues will make you say Hmm.
In our program, Rupert's Kids, we find where a young man or woman's aptitude lies.
You have to get them interested in something.
When you are not making it in education, the only alternative is to focus on vocation.
If the school is letting you or your child down, I am sorry.
It's one of the reasons I am running.
I see this too often.
My suggestion is to take what a child is most interested in and find shadow opportunities.
Ask local businesses to let them shadow for a day.
No death!
But in a fight, you never count Sandra out!
She is a tough one, and you have to be tough to win Survivor TWICE!
Good luck in your race, Hardy!
Please check my answer about my future plans.
If, by some crazy chance, I don't win this time I will run in four years.
We WILL hold the winner's feet to the fire, and you will hear what I have to say about the decisions being made.
I will be speaking about what I'd do as Governor.
I will say that I will throw myself back in to Rupert's Kids with the same passion I've had for this race.
It's a privilege to see lives being changed through our programs.
I feel like it is the only real way to change the system for the better.
Trying to change the system from my position as a well-known community advocate got me polite thanks and pats on the back, but it didn't bring as much progress as I'd like to see.
As one of the policy makers is the only real way to change the system.
As a third party candidate, I am seeing my ideas and phrases being adopted by my opponents.
I am running because I have something to say.
For anyone out there who feels as if they have something to say and want to make a difference, you have to run.
It's our first amendment right!
You have the right to assemble with other like minded individuals, speak freely, and protest the government.
And the government should make no laws to stop that from happening!
We have been given more media than most Libertarians, or most thirds parties, but we are still largely ignored.
In some cases, it is blatant censorship.
In other cases, it's lazy media.
there will be three choices in Indiana because of automatic ballot access.
If a media outlet cares about giving the voter good information, they will cover Libertarians equally.
We were included in all three Gubernatorial debates because the Indiana Debate Commission truly puts the voter first and gives complete information to the voter.
I am running for Governor in a system that is not designed to understand the NAP.
It's a brutal system, and it needs reformed.
I am working to reform that system when I am elected in January.
As Libertarians, it's a difficult tight rope, because it may take 100 years to achieve our destination, but we are running for office NOW.
Please see my note on poll numbers in another question.
We need to continue what we are doing.
People are listening, and are ready.
The LPIN Executive Director, Chris Spangle, was telling me earlier that 4 years ago on this same night, there were 10 volunteers with a couple of hundred pieces of literature on Election Day, and a dozen yard signs.
The volunteers had no idea what to do.
Tonight, we've passed out 70,000 pieces of literature to hundreds of volunteers for our LP candidates.
It takes every Libertarian realizing that it isn't just on the party to ensure growth.... You ARE the party, and we need every libertarian to be active to help us grow.
Conservation is incredibly important to me.
We need to protect our environment, especially since Indiana relies so heavily on agricultural and environmental tourism.
We need to encourage businesses to be good stewards of the Earth, and still be able to conduct business.
In Indiana there have been some troubling deals with our energy companies, and we need more transparency in all future projects.
The menu is the same, win or lose.
We are going to celebrate, and I am going to continue to find ways to serve my community.
We plan on winning, and I am excited to go to work for Indiana on Wednesday.
The rule is to keep it out of camp.
You don't get bathrooms.
The only toilet paper is hanging on the trees!
I have signed the NAP as a member of the Libertarian Party, and support it fully.
For those unfamiliar with the NAP, it's what every Libertarian member signs, and is as follows: "I hereby certify that I do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of achieving political or social goals."
First, in Indiana, they don't release polling numbers for early voting in individual races.
What they do release is heavily skewed and not an accurate view of what will happen on Tuesday.
For them to show us pulling 5% or so is silly.
You have to look at the questions and the methodology of these polls.
If they don't release that, discount it immediately.
If they do, I am not often mentioned in most or all of the questions, and I am still polling 5%.
Here is a snapshot of our internal polling.
It tells a far different story.
Notice our margin of error is far lower, and our sampling far higher, than other polls.
We will not lay down
November change is near
for it's our time now
Thank you!
Be sure to tell your dad I said Hi.
Thank you so much!
I really appreciate your support!
Thanks buddy!
I love my Aussie friends!
No way to BSL!
It's not the breed that makes a bad *blank* it's the bad owner!
If you treat an animal with love and respect, that's what you'll get back.
If you are violent and abusive...you'll get bit!
I really do appreciate that!
Do you have any friends or family here in Indiana that you can share our message with?
Because that would be a big help, too.
Thanks buddy!
Thank you so much for the support!
Was that one of the First Friday events?
What more do I need to do to persuade you?
I am for sure going to do another one on November 4th.
Keep an eye out for it on my Facebook page and Twitter feed.
And I gave it away.
$487,000 in taxes, $236,000 on my family (bills, used car for mom, daughter's education, house payments etc) and then split $277,000 between three local charities.
We pay our taxes, take care of our home and then help others.
Way to be secure in your sexuality.
You are correct.
You are an individual and responsible for your actions alone.
I feel that the majority of people have been complacent and allowed these things to happen over time.
It's on us (you, me and the rest of liberty movement) to do what we can to show them that how this happened and how "we" can fix it.
Did you know that almost 50% of state budget goes to education?
I don't think we aren't spending enough...I think we are spending poorly.
We need to do more to increase education competitiveness.
We need to bring new technology and new ways of teaching into our classrooms.
We need to champion our dedicated teachers.
We also must understand that not every student needs or wants to go to college.
Some students will want to go into vocational and trades programs.
When 25% of students in Indiana, closer to 50% in Indianapolis, will not graduate... we need new options and education paths for students.
I saw it and giggled a little.
1620!
We.. are the ones that have let this happen.
We are the ones that have given the power to these people.
We are the ones that can make it right and take it back.
As in the societal or collective "We".
We (haha) are a team and can only do this together.
It's not about me or I...
It's Our Time!
Ok everyone it's after 9pm.
I need to go and tuck my daughter into bed.
I'll be coming in here over the next few days and responding to some of the questions I didn't get to.
What do you think... should we do this again Sunday November 4th at 7pm?
I have worked for 21 years running a mentoring program that takes young men and women and teaches them how to have self worth and work ethic.
We've done this with NO government dollars, tax dollars or grant funding.
We are a 100% private charity that runs on donations and community support.
We need more programs like that working on the local level addressing the needs of the individual.
Not some bureaucratic behemoth making arbitrary rules and tying them to funding.
I can't single out one individual program that I would cute from.
I can say that if cuts are needed, it will always start with administration costs first.
Tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito!
In short... all of it!
Austrian School of economics meets Indiana 2013-14 budgets ;)
Mostly it's been positive.
People saw me when I was at my lowest (beat down to nothing) and I was still the good guy.
Also, people know that I took the money and the small celebrity status and helped strengthen my community with it.
No one makes all the right decisions in life, it's what you do after you see the mistake that matters.
Do you own it, correct and move on...or do you live in fear of it?
I have no regrets...well maybe the dress wasn't  a great visual for a future Governor.
You really can't tell how much physical pain they are in.
The toll hunger can have on you.
How easy it is to let the boredom in and just sit and complain (wasn't a problem for me...I went fishing).
Rudy Bosh, Grave Digger James...and of course Me :)
We need to treat animal cruelty and torture as just that.
Not some petty crime where you get a fine.
We also need to make sure that local prosecutors actually take these cases on.
What is BSL?
Stopping the privatization of our prison system is of the utmost importance.
Putting and keeping people in jail should never be a for profit endeavor.
When there is a financial incentive to keep people in the system there is no way out.
These are peoples lives.
I will keep on fighting to bring this issue to light and will work to cancel these contracts.
As a small business owner and youth advocate, I have experienced firsthand the effect governmental roadblocks placed in front of our struggling small business continue to have.
I felt that Indiana needed a leader that understands the struggles that Hoosiers are facing.
Not some polished politician that has a perfect sound bite for everything.
I am running as a Libertarian for one simple reason...I am a proud Libertarian.
It may have taken most of life to figure out that I had been living and teaching the Libertarian philosophy for years!
It was when I first took the [Worlds Smallest Political Quiz](http://theadvocates.org/) that I discovered there was a political party that I trully alligned with.
My team has been calling all 92 counties in Indiana to get Watcher cards for election day.
The Democrats and Republicans get these, clerks and judges on election day.
We have had a very hard time getting our poll workers their credentials.
Why?
Because even something as simple as being able to "watch" and make sure nothing funny is going on at the polls...is a partisan thing.
Our system is designed to keep the two parties in power.
I think our dedicated activists and volunteers have been chipping away at it... and now it's starting to crumble.
There are a few people that have said I should shave the beard and ditch my tie-dye undershirts.
Why would I change who I am just to get elected.
After all, these fake polished politicians are the problem.
If you want honesty and integrity in government...let's start by being ourselves first and not what we think people want us to be.
As the only candidate that has created private sector jobs and taught young men and women how to create jobs for themselves, I understand the consequences of misguided government policy.
These misguided policies are what make your college tuition high and job prospects low.
At the end of the day, I’m not a career politician I’m a small business owner.
whether it's people or animals, my family and I have always stood up for those that can't defend themselves.
Our "pets" are members of our family.
When it comes to farms we have to remember we are not talking about pets, we are talking about our food supply.
But, cruelty and torture are never acceptable.
Period!
Hey there Rosie!
I'm sorry you are in the hospital.
You and your sister have been in my thoughts.
Hope you both are able to come to the election night party with Jason.
In the past I've helped to build community based neighborhood cleanup projects.
We worked with the city to get a trash truck and a few supplies.
Communities can be empowered to take these actions on their own, when the government has failed to do it.
I would be more than happy to talk with you more about how to setup one of these programs.
Heck, I would even come and help out.
One thing that I think would help prevent this from being a problem would be first-time homeowner programs sponsored by the city.
The city of Indianapolis has tons of livable housing in it's "Land Bank".
But it's all just sitting there rotting.
I think I've proven that I'm not in this as a career politician or using this as a stepping stone to the White House.
I'm a hardworking Hoosier that truly understands the effect misguided government programs and laws can have on the average person and small business.
I bring compassion and accountability with me to the Governor's office.
It's the way we stay out of each other's business, but are right there ready to help when it hits the fan.
Stopping the privatization of our prison system.
Putting people in jail should never be a for profit endeavor.
When there is a financial incentive to keep people in the system there is no way out.
These are peoples lives.
The next step is to create a REAL reentry program that helps people get educated, employed and living with a sense of self worth and work ethic.
Well...I say we are going to win!
That's why I'm in this race.
We've literally put everything we have in this campaign.
Myself, my family, my friends and my wonderful all volunteer team... we believe in it.
It's Our Time!
I would say Sandra for her playing the game with integrity and pretty much on her own, both times.
Battling sleep deprivation, starvation, endless challenges and conniving backstabbers... Then there was my time on Survivor.
Neither.
I wouldn't hurt any animal.
Especially something as special and unique as a duck sized horse or a horse sized duck.
But if I was still on Survivor and lost the last challenge for a steak... that's a horse of a different breed.
10 seconds after the intro...but instead of beating up on my poor TV, I would probably just change the channel ;)
Thank you for standing up and taking on the unsung task of teaching young people.
Teachers should be held up as our heroes!
First thing I'm going to do as Governor is cut 10 to 20% from the administration portions of our education budget.
I will then redirect that money back into the classroom.
We need more teachers, better pay for teachers, smaller class sizes and new technology.
Then I'm going to END the I-STEP!
Teachers should be teaching to the student not to a test.
We need to show our youth that life isn't multiple choice, it's an essay.
Both Dr. Bennett and Mrs. Ritz have a passion for education.
They go about it different ways, but are both truly committed to educating Hoosiers.
I just hope they both will drop any support for Common Core.
We can't keep putting people in jail for hurting themselves.
A state study just came out showing that our prisons are over capacity and we'll need to build more.
Instead of doing that...
I think we need to change the way we handle drug addiction.
It's a medical condition, not a crime.
Let's get through this race before we start planning the next one ;)
The bumper sticker...
So you want me to subsidies both your bumper sticker and the postage to send it to you???
Ok, just this once.
You should vote for me because you are "disgusted" by the major parties.
Nothing changes if you don't vote for the change.
If you like my policies, how I approach things and my sense of personal responsibility...then you should use your vote as a loud voice demanding change in the system.
Tesla Armada rocked it that night!
I think Gov.
Daniels has had some ups and some really big downs.
Our state isn't broke (we actually have a $2.7 billion surplus), but the way he's kept the state in the green is a little dishonest.
Saying we are going to be short and cutting $300 million from the budget (for local schools, libraries, public safety and roads) just to find $288 million laying around in a bank account?
I think you answered the second one yourself.
I'm no corrupt, not a career politician and I carry a copy of the US Constitution (and now Indiana, too) in my back pocket.
Thank you so much!
I think it got boring when it went from being a battle against yourself to a battle against others.
It's not Survivor anymore, now it's Conniver.
Empower, Fund and Choice
Educate, Deregulate and Promote
HIP, Hybrid-Exchange and Community
Reentry, Educate and Employ
Constitution, Fairness and Equality
No way do I want to be a career politician!
When I leave office after 8 years of service to Hoosiers I'll still be doing what I always... advocate for youth and community empowerment programs.
Two 4 year terms is all you can do as Governor.
The first thing we MUST do is change the way we deal with non-violent offenders.
We need to stop locking people up for hurting themselves.
Then we need to create the programs and opportunities that help keep first time offenders from getting stuck in the revolving door of the criminal "justice" system.
If we help you learn how to go out and make a legal living the state will save lives and money.
We can spend a little today or $50,000+ a year when someone becomes a career criminal.
I think that was the after party for Indy visit of the Libertarian Presidential candidate, Gov Gary Johnson.
I liked Tesla Armada, too.
I wake up every morning by 7am and head out to work with the young men in my mentoring program.
Then I head downtown to the campaign HQ and meet with staff, make calls and go over the day.
Then I'm on the road, traveling the state, until 11 to 12 at night.
But...
I would love to sleep in if I could.
Of course there is a place for third parties in the US elections.
Our society has been divided between left and right ways of thinking for far too long.
We need other options and other voices that better represent the people.
In my race, I have been able to set the tone for many, mostly ignored, issues.
In this election I've helped give a voice to small towns and the forgotten people on the edges of society.
Hands down Heros and Villians was the hardest season... in the first hour I broke three bones in my foot.
Ouch!
But I still stayed in there in played the game for 36 days.
Thank you so much!
Being on Survivor gave me a chance to show the world who I am and what we Hoosier boys can do.
I think people saw in me honesty and integrity, even when I was beat down and starving.
I've been able to be for 48 years here's to the next 48 and hopefully 8 of them as Governor of Indiana.
If by some chance I'm not elected as Governor, this time, I have already pledged to a few Marriage Equality groups that I will campaign against HJR.
Good, man.
As good as I can be for being the first one out of the darn game!
I want to thank you for that question because… No!
Darnit!
I never even got to play.
I never went out on my island.
I never got to be with my tribe.
I never even walked in to Tribal Council.
This was so different from every other time I played “Survivor,” but when you bring someone with you that is more important than the darned game, that’s what happens.
Well, honestly, being out on Redemption Island with Candice… Candice and I don’t have the best relationship in the world.
We didn’t even really like each other in “Heroes vs. Villains.” I always said the girl should have been on the “Villains” side.
But honestly?
I tried to stay away from Candice as much as I could, wait for her to go to sleep and then go out and catch me a few lobsters, catch me some clams, get me some fish, cook it up real quick on the fire and get it eaten before the girl wakes up.
Oh gosh yes!
There were these cool little lobsters.
They were small little lobsters, maybe four or five inches long, but they were everywhere.
You could go out there and grab these things if you were quick.
I grabbed two or three of them, put maybe an inch of water in the pan, got it boiling real quick, throw ’em in, you could cook ’em in three or four minutes and have then eaten before the girl ever knew what was going on.
I had already had it in my head that Redemption Island is probably not going to play into my strengths.
It’s not going to be an endurance challenge, because they don’t want it to last for hours and hours.
It’s not going to be a strength challenge, because I’m going up against girls and people that are not as strong as I am.
It sure can’t be the swimming or the physical.
When I saw that it was a balance and an eyesight challenge, the two things that I’m not as good at as I get older… My eyesight is a little off and my balance is a little off.
In a few months I’m going to be 50 years old going up against these 20-something-year-old kids.
But I have to say that if I would have just calmed myself down, I could have done better.
Watching that on TV, I was so freaked out before I walked into the game.
I started going through my previous times in “Survivor.” I’ve won a lot of Reward challenges, but I have never won an Individual Immunity challenge.
I kept playing that out in my head.
I tried to get it out, but I had myself so freaked out before I walked into Redemption Island and I couldn’t calm down.
You know, 10 years ago when I went out on “Pearl Islands,” the pirate adventure, I was 39 years old.
I was in some great shape.
I might have been 265 pounds, but I was pretty tough.
Then I did “All-Stars” back-to-back.
I was the first one to do back-to-back and I did even better.
I made it 10 days longer in a game that was harder, with harder players.
Then six years go by and I play the game again at 46 and in the first hour of the game I break three bones in my foot and I still stayed 36 days with those bones floating around and in just outrageous pain.
At 49 when I went out to play?
I wish I would have gotten the ability to go out on the island and actually be involved, because I am now back in a lot better shape than I was when I was 46.
I’m back to where I feel like I’m 35 again instead of 49.
I’ve watched that a bunch of times.
I keep rewinding that little scenario trying to see why they targeted Laura.
The reasons that I can come up with: Everybody knew her name, because everyone knows Laura, all of the Survivors, we all know Laura.
And it was not so much again Laura, but I think it was a strike against me.
That’s kinda what I see, really, even though we didn’t know that that first person, that the people we voted out would have the chance to switch with their loved ones.
I think it was the Newbie players going after one of the big Returning players.
I was surprised by not only Jeff, but my own tribe!
If you noticed, they didn’t even move out of my way.
I had to push my way through my tribe with them begging me to stay, with them telling me, “No, don’t trade.” And I looked at them and said, “Are you kidding?
Of course I have to trade.
I’m sorry, but she’s tough, too.” Before we out on the island, Laura and I talked about how this had the potential of destroying relationships or empowering them and making them even strong.
I’m glad that our relationship is even stronger.
There’s no way I could do any other choice but to trade places with Laura.
I don’t understand.
I mean, Jeff should have known straight off the bat, I’m trading.
We talked about that a little bit.
Laura and I talked about, you know, I’m sure they’re gonna get us to a point sometime in the game where we have to decide about, “Are we gonna vote out our loved ones or not?” I mean, there’s only going to be one winner and it’s probably not gonna be couples making it all the way to the end.
They’re gonna separate people.
But we didn’t think it would happen right off the bat.
We thought we were gonna go out there and be playing together.
When they dropped us off on the little deserted areas sprinkled around this island and Laura and I got to spend that first night together, I thought, “Oh my gosh!
This is gonna be my favorite ‘Survivor.’ I get to go through this experience with the person  I love!” And then Jeff says, “Why are you all smiling?
You guys are separating.” Ugh.
That was tough.
I had told Laura before we ever went out, “It doesn’t matter what happens, I would never write your name down!” But I know that I am gonna be one of the targets out there.
I always am!
I told her, “If we’ve made it to the Merge, if we’re down and they start targeting me, it’s really OK. You stay in that alliance and you target me with them, because only one of us is going to make it to the end.” And I would never have any bad feelings about my wife writing my name down.
If it made her game stronger, write my name down, even though she told me there’s no way she’d ever write my name down unless it’s for the million dollars.
Oh yes!
You know, there are a lot of people out there that understand that it is just a game, but I tell you what… When you go out there and you play that game, when you go through such deprivation, such dehydration, malnutrition, just being beaten down, it’s amazing how the emotions start coming out.
Really, it’s going to get to the point where even just seeing your loved one is going to bring… I mean, we’ve already seen it last night when the Newbies came back and all the Returning players were sitting there in Redemption Island Arena and they start crying because their loved ones are still there!
The emotions in this game… I tell people all the time, sometimes you even forget about the million dollars and you just want to feel OK.
The new players will be in that situations.
The returning players, they know that.
It’s such a mental trip to go on that I have to say that I’m sad that I didn’t get a chance to play, but I’m thrilled that my wife is still in that hunt for a million dollars.
And for anybody out there that doesn’t stand up and trade and that does look at themselves as, “I’ve got a better chance, so I’m gonna take that,” hopefully it doesn’t destroy their relationship.
When I left “Heroes and Villains,” I said, “I really want to play at least one more time, but let’s do it before I turn 50.” I’m getting older and the game is getting harder.
Now, shoot, in January I’m gonna be 50 years old, but I’m also in better shape.
I would love to go out there and play the game one more time and actually get on the tribe, get onto the island, get into the game and show that 27 years in the mental health field have not gone to waste.
I’m pretty good at manipulating.
I was sure hopeful, and I wanted Russell to believe that I believed him, but no.
I looked at Colby right afterward and I said, “You know it’s still just you and I.”
Russell is one of the most evil people I have ever met.
He is the epitome of the manipulative, self-centered kind of guy who just looks at people for what he can get out of them.
I tried to show them that when you use people to get to the top that you’re still never going to be a winner.
I was crying just watching the video and thinking about her being there.
This is the first anniversary that we haven’t spent together, so that was like our anniversary celebration.
That was a big deal.
I have to say, even though it’s only thirty days it feels like a lifetime because of all the craziness going on.
Everything is intensified.
I don’t know that Laura will ever be a contestant.
We’ve talked about being on “The Amazing Race” but the “Family Survivor?” My wife and daughter would not really be too happy to be out there playing “Survivor.”
If you go out there as a complete good guy you’re not going to win the game.
But you have to show that you don’t have to be such an evil villain.
It does matter how you treat yourself and the people around you.
And when you’re using and manipulating everyone, of course you’re going to be seen as a villain.
But, I’m no angel.
I went to some people and said, “They’re coming to get you.” That’s part of the game.
I finally found out after I was voted out, it wasn’t just one broken bone in my toe, it was two broken bones in my toe, and the toe we were taping it off to was broken also!
I am out of my mind in pain every day on “Survivor.” When my toe was looking back at me, and I straightened it and taped it off to another broken toe, I was in more pain than I’ve ever felt in my entire life.
Even my daughter when she’s watching it on TV says, “Oh Dad, you looked a little mad last night.” And I told her, it’s not that I’m mad, I’m just in pain.
I’m a little shorter with my “Survivor” cast mates.
The pain in my toe definitely affected my attitude.
Oh my God!
My wife and daughter were so proud of me.
And they never showed it, but I never said I had the hidden immunity idol.
I wasn’t being a big liar about it.
But I made sure everyone saw the big rock in my pocket.
That was a great moment in our household.
Mean cougar.
I want to say good guy, but I’ll say good soft guy.
Cause he was kinda soft.
Toughest man I’ve ever met.
Sweetest Survivor in history.
A little girl who’s used to batting her eyes and getting what she wants.
Glad she was gone before me.
Not what you think.
Silly…silliest move ever!
Evil…pure evil.
That I’m still tough.
I’m 46 years old, but I’m still the tough guy on “Survivor” and it still counts how you play the game.
My kids love seeing that.
Most of the contestants knew who I was.
They are very big Survivor fans and watch Survivor US on the internet and on TV in their own countries.
It was very interesting to hear about the Israeli culture.
They are very high energy, exciting men and women and they reminded me of my buddies and friends back home.
Of course I was worried about being the first person voted out.
But I also remember the pain of Survivor, and if you can help eliminate some of that pain, you are looked at as a benefit to the tribe.
I spent the first million dollars in a matter of weeks.
But I met life goals with it.
$277,000 went to charity.
Only part of that went to Rupert's Kids.
My daughter got her college fund.
My family got out of debt and the government got a check for $487,000.
If I am lucky enough to win a second million dollars, I am sure I would do exactly the same thing.
I was the first Survivor ever to do back to back Survivors.
Yes, it was hard on my body and my mind.
Now that I have had six years in between Survivors, I plan on going back out there with all the gusto I can muster.
I like being me!
That is one amazing combination of strength and Survivor knowledge.
I would hope we are dominant in all of the challenges.
I know I'll show my strength and value.
I hope everyone else can.
I have trained all of my life in the school of hard knocks.
I show the younger generation how working hard every day can build your muscles, your body and your mind.
What Colby and I were doing there, we had the chance to get Russell by himself -- the three girls had just gone off to their Reward Challenge with their loved ones -- and Russell was just fuming back at camp.
That's when Colby and I jumped all over that, saying, "You realize Russell those three women are going to eliminate you.
As soon as they get Colby out, they're going to get you out.
You're not making it to the final Tribal Council.
The only way guaranteed you can make it to final Tribal Council is to take Colby and I.
You know whole-hearted that we want you there."
It's not that I had such a great alliance or trust with Russell.
But it was that last-ditch effort.
Just like the rock in my pocket.
I'm trying to come up with any kind of anything that can help me make one more day.
The entire season.
I thought I was going to be able to come back because there were so many times where if my team would have just stayed to the plan we would have been the Heroes in the final Tribal Council instead of having Villains in the final Tribal Council.
I thought I had this whole season.
I knew when I was walking into that last Tribal Council that I was probably on borrowed.
When I looked into the camera, I really thought this one was mine.
What I was trying to show Russell was, "Look, even these women that you say you're in an alliance with, they don't even take you out to go out with loved ones."
It was only Russell and I that had wives and they didn't let anyone of us stay with our wives.
"Russell, if they really thought anything about you they would have given that Reward with your wife.
That should prove it to you."
I was almost banking on it.
That's what I told Russell, I looked him right in the eye and said, "Guaranteed, you are my guy in the Final 3.
Colby, Russell and I.
That's all I want.
I don't want any of the other Villains.
You're the best Villain out there.
If you want to show that you are the toughest and at the top, you take the best with you, right Russell?
If you think you really deserve to win this, you should take Colby and I.
So align with us and make sure you get there."
I still kind of doubt that.
They just would have switched from voting me out to voting Colby out if I had instead won Immunity.
I talked to Russell and I talked to Sandra.
Jerri was so against me.
I think that still all goes back to when we played All-Stars together.
She still hates the shelter that I built that she blames for that she helped build too!
One-hundred percent.
When I went to Russell and said, "Sandra and the girls are trying to get you out of here," I was going to... That was... Let me think how I can lay this out.
When Sandra came to me first and said she wanted to get Russell out, I agreed with her 100%.
We went to Tribal Council and she still said she was writing Russell's name down.
Of course she wrote mine.
With Sandra, I never really knew where to believe her at.
Now with the Tribal Council right before when they voted Danielle out, I had kind of helped perpetuate the fight between Danielle, Parvati and Russell.
I was hoping that I could continue that fight and that distrust in the Villains mind where, "See Russell, these women are trying to put you out."
I had already exhausted every opportunity with Sandra, trying to convince Sandra to stop siding with him and go up against him.
Oh, 100%.
When I put the rock in my pocket, I thought the Hidden Immunity Idol was still out there but it was just so well hidden that nobody had found it.
One-hundred percent.
If I would have known Sandra had that Hidden Immunity Idol, I would most-definitely went to her saying, "If you're really serious, this is your time to get Russell out."
I had no clue.
Candice had came to me 100% on our side.
Looking back on it, I realize there were some signs.
But when you're out there in the game there's so much going on -- you're so hungry and you're so tired and you're so thirsty and so beat up -- I could not believe that Candice was going to side with Russell.
As much as she hated Russell and talked so bad about him, then she went over to side with him?
I couldn't believe it.
I have to say, with Tom and Stephanie, we would get back from a challenge and they would be beating up the rest of the tribe for how bad we did.
I would look at them and say, "Instead of beating others, instead of blaming others, we need to look at ourselves."
People don't like always when they are confronted with the truth.
Tom would look at James and say how mean and bullyish he is, but then turn right around and look at me and say, "You know the only reason you're still out here is because we've got you and we're taking care of you."
There was a lot of egos out there.
I was going through it with not just one broken bone in one toe, but two broken bones in one toe and the toe they were taping it off to was also broken!
So a lot of pain.
I was a little shorter tempered but I also tried to be that motivator and that one that empowered us.
Some of our team didn't always like that.
You know, I had the opportunity to stay with the Morgan tribe, and I probably should have.
They were the more honorable tribe.
They may have been a little more lazy, but that was because of their leadership, I think.
I tried to lead by example, so everyone had to keep up with me.
On their tribe, they didn't really have good leadership, so I think if I had gone over there, or stayed over there when I had the chance, my game would have been a lot better.
On the Drake tribe, there was no way that Shawn, Burton, and Michelle were going to let me be the "official leader".
They were the leading group.
Shawn thought he was the leader, Burton thought he was the leader, and Michelle thought she had them both wrapped around her finger.
It worked okay for us, only because I let them think they were leaders.
For the other tribe, they picked the best of the bunch (laughs), but even still - sometimes, like Jeff said, sometimes societies kill their leaders, but in their case, it might not have worked at all for them to "kill" their leader and try someone else.
You know, even though Jonny Foreskin was a pain in the butt, they never really showed the nicer side of the guy.
He was a great gameplayer, and a great manipulator, and a real pain in the butt, but he also had a nice side.
He was my little budy through most of the game, and I never realized what a conniver he was.
But they never showed that side of Jon.
The for the most part, the rest were pretty accurately portrayed.
Darrah - shy and quiet.
Tijuana, argumentative.
Savage and RyanO, both good guys, but better followers than leaders.
Shawn, Burton, and Michelle, the jocks and cheerleaders that thought they were a little better than everyone else.
Christa, Sandra, and I who kind of went through and played the worker bees.
And Sandra, especially, getting through her game playing the opinionated little Puerto Rican girl, she did great!
Everybody was portrayed pretty accurately.
Christa, she proved that she was the next toughest dude out there.
When the strength challenges came up, she was always right up there, ranking with the guys.
I liked Christa a lot.
She got a bad rap from Survivor, but she was a pretty good girl.
She was very good.
It was close.
When I saw Christa and Sandra say "we've got to do something about Rupert," that felt kinda bad.
But you've got to remember that it is a game, and even though Sandra and Christa were on my side 100%, I don't blame them for not wanting to bring me to the Final 2.
I think I would have beaten either one of them.
I think I would have beaten anyone in a Final 2.
But, you've also got to remember that it was Sandra and Christa that saved me.
If they wouldn't have been privy to the information that Trish and Jon were spewing, I would have been gone.
When Sandra cast that vote, Sandra, Christa, and I had agreed all along that it was going to be a vote for Darrah.
There were going to be seven of us voting for Darrah.
Unfortunately, that's not the case, and Sandra just wanted to write Jon's name down.
I wish it would have worked out different.
But if it would have been a 4-4 tie, Sandra would have killed me there, writing down Jon's name.
But as it worked out, just Christa and I voted for Darrah, and with the exception of Sandra, everyone else voted for me anyway.
I hated seeing that side of me coming out.
The selfish Rupert was coming out.
it was my spear, my tribe, my island, my adventure.
I didn't like seeing that side of me.
Sitting back, watching on TV helped me understand that that's not who I really want to be.
And saying that I just got worn down and got a little selfish is not a good enough excuse for me.
That bothered me so much, it made me a lot better at sharing.
Because I didn't like that cocky Rupert at all.
Seeing the way I was acting on TV definitely explained a little bit of why they had to get rid of me.
If I would have found somebody that cocky in the game, I would have been targeting them, too.
When we merged, after the big meal, I went to Andrew and RyanO, and said "you guys can pick either Darrah or Tijuana, and get with Sandra, Christa, and I, and whichever you don't pick, we'll all vote them off as a sign of good faith.
Because I don't want to put the Drakes down, I want to be able to trust you guys - you know I'm trustworthy.
We'll all help each other out, and we'll be 3 and 3."
They did not want to do that.
They wanted us to vote Jonny Foreskin out.
I didn't want to do that, I didn't want to put us down, I couldn't trust them enough.
The last 2 minutes before Tribal Council, Andrew came back to me and said "Okay, I'll give you Tijuana."
I told him it was too late.
We'd already made the plans to vote Andrew out, we'd already turned Lill and gotten her to vote with us.
I gave Andrew and RyanO the opportunity very first, and they turned me down.
I would have loved to have been in an alliance with those two, but they didn't want to do it my way until they had no other options, and by then it was too late.
I was thinking that the final 4 would be Sandra, Christa, and I, and probably Andrew Savage.
Sandra might have been out, and RyanO might have been in there.
It's still amazing to me.
To read all the fan mail, all the letters and the Christmas cards have been wonderful.
I'm still answering letters from November, I haven't even gotten to December yet.
I get so much fan mail, it's wonderful.
It's wonderful.
I love it.
It's like a dream.
Every once in a while I get on the internet, but I've been so swamped with letters that I spend most of my time answering those.
I try to answer 20 or 30 letters a day, and I get in way more than that a day right now.
So I'm way behind, and I haven't gotten on the internet much.
I love getting into discussion boards and reading what everyone says about me.
Every once in a while when I can get away from the letters, I do love getting on-line and seeing that.
I was waiting all the way through the game.
I wanted to hear someone say something about the shoes, and I never did through the whole game.
I couldn't ask about it, or say anything about taking them.
Then, when the first episode aired, still no one said anything about them.
I had to wait until the reunion show, and at the reunion show, Andrew said "I wondered what happened to those darn shoes!"
It's the only time anyone ever said anything, it's so funny.
But hey, it was a pirate adventure, and I started mine early.
There was no way, when I got taken over there and they were so happy about winning, no way I would ever have told them we threw the challenge.
They were happy that I sat out, and they couldn't understand why I sat out.
I told them that I wasn't happy about it, it was just our rotation.
There's no way I would have told them.
I didn't want to hurt them, and I sure didn't want to do it when I had to spend two or three days with them.
Luckily, during the first few days, they didn't show my weaker side.
I'd sit up at night and just be freaked out and pissed off that I let Shawn and Burton and Michelle make fun of me all day.
I went out there, and after a few days, the gruff exterior of Rupert got stripped away, and I was down to the scared little fat kid.
And it took the twelve days in Jury camp for me to realize why I went back to the Drake tribe that didn't treat me too well, instead of staying with the Morgan tribe that genuinely treated me great.
Figuring out my comfort level was more being told I was "not".
Survivor has built my confidence so it's not so much of an act any more.
I used to be a great actor of self-confidence, until I got questioned about it, then I'd run away.
I don't run away any more.
I believe in myself a whole lot more now.
When I'm mentoring the kids, having that understanding of being the kid that doesn't fit in, and that never really let that go... You know, I'm going to be 40 years old in a couple of weeks, and I still carry that around.
And that makes it a lot easier for me to understand my kids that don't fit in, either.
And they see that in me.
We call ourselves misfits.
I call myself a misfit - I would never call one of them a misfit.
But now I feel like I fit in a whole lot more.
You know, on TV, it showed me finding it in about 5 minutes.
It took four and a half hours or swimming non-stop in a grid pattern!
Shawn didn't know where the hell he lost it.
He was totally lying through that whole scenario.
He had no idea where he lost it.
When he showed me, he said "somewhere between the rocks and the trees," he showed me an area that was the whole inlet.
It's monstrous!
And so, four and a half hours to find that darn spear head.
I'm so happy that I was able I was able to be involved for ten years and I love the darn game!
Survivor will test you to your core.
Just last year, I ran for governor of Indiana.
I like a challenge!
They asked if I wanted to play again and I said of course.
Then they asked if I wanted to bring a loved one.
I gave them different people and I didn't say my wife right away because I knew it would help and hurt to take somebody like that but she said, "I wanna play!"
No regrets.
I'm trying to hold the tears back as I leave the game I love, but I was able to rescue my wife.
I really don't think so.
She's stronger than me, she's a better swimmer than me, she's a better puzzle builder than I am... and now she's a free agent!
She'll be able to be that pawn that they can use.
I watched Sandra win the game twice as she said, "I'll vote for anybody as long as it's not me!"
Life on Redemption Island was irritating, to say the least.
Candice and I have not had the best relationship in the past.
We didn't even really like each other on Heroes Vs. Villains but she got used to me doing everything.
I didn't do that on Redemption Island.
I would wait for Candice to go to sleep this time before I did anything!
You know...
I never thought I would be the first one out.
When I went into Redemption Island, I already had it in my head that it wasn't going to play to my strengths.
I said to myself, "It's going to be probably not going to be a good challenge for you."
I saw it was balance and eyesight and those are my two weaknesses, honestly, as I get older.
I needed my glasses!
I've said for years that they're giving them too much food and stuff!
I like the old game... in All Stars, they gave us a machete and a pot and said good luck.
There was nothing!
If you couldn't catch it, you didn't get it.
That honestly made the game more of a Survivor style game.
When you give them enough food and supplies, saws and hammers, it makes it so it's not as physically demanding so it turns it into a social game.
It's not Survivor, it's Conniver.
Being able to be that one that floats.
It shows you're not as tied to your loved one as you are to your tribe.
When Brad stepped up and said, "I would feel bad if I beat my wife because I want her to win," that is going to come back and haunt him.
You've got to be able to show that, like Laura said, you're a free agent.
I've been running my program for 23 years.
I'm opening another chapter in a town, outside of Indianapolis, in Shelbyville.
We're gonna put the vocational education back in the public schools and a re-entry program in the detention centers and with no public funding.
We're going to change this community!
I LOVE THE GAME!
I want to make sure that everybody sees that I’m taking care of you.
If I can do that, I can make it through the first few votes, I’m solid.
making you feel like I care, which I do–it’s not just an act, but in the game, I care a little more about myself than normally, and I will maneuver people if it helps me get further in the game.
My wife let me know as I was walking out the door, “Your one weakness is that you believe people, you believe in people, you want to show the best side of people, you want to help encourage that side.
So in the game, try not to trust people.
… That’s where my game will differ a little, because I won’t blindly trust anyone this time.
I can’t.
I’m not going to start working out like crazy and beating yourself up.
my preparation is doing the research and the mental game.
… There’s very few real, true good times out there, and there’s a whole lotta hard times.
That’s what I’m trying to prepare myself for, those hard times.
When I went into Survivor, I never in a million years thought at all that I would turn into a celebrity.
… It gave me the ability to go run around the world and be me.
That’s my new job, I get to run around and be me.
People have no idea who you are, just like they really have no idea who I am.
And for them to run up and say they love me or hug me and kiss me and cuddle me and give me their votes–I love it, I will never be tired of people gushing love on me, but I also know that they have their own idea in their head of who I am.
And it might be who I am and it might not be, but it doesn’t matter.
When people are just constantly telling you that you’re good, I find it a lot easier just not to believe it.
I’m glad you approve, but I’m just me.
It would be very easy to buy into it, because for years, and they still do, tell me how great I am or how wonderful.
But I do not want to be that guy who thinks they’re any better than anyone else.”
Winning and losing isn’t as important as playing with honor, playing with heart.
I was no damn angel.
No one can say they did everything right, they didn’t lie or cheat.
It’s okay.
I played with at least some honor.
Hard and tough, not being any angel.
Of course, I’m going to tell lies; there’s not a darn person out there in this world that doesn’t tell a lie.
But still playing the game with honor, playing it with respect, being able to show people that it counts.
And I hope that I get to do that.
My big hope, though?
Jeff Probst writing another million dollar check on my back.
This one, I’d love to win it myself.
Didn’t know me, so it was easy for me to be quiet and just be a worker.
Everybody knows me out here.
I can’t be the quiet one out here.
I am the out, in-your-face, tough, big, hairy, scary, help-you person.
I want to make sure that everybody sees that I’m taking care of you.
If I can do that, I can make it through the first few votes, I’m solid.
I will win Survivor because I am the toughest, the baddest, the most intense player I know.
My family warned me as I’m walking out the door not to just blindly trust everybody.
That was my problem in Pearl Islands and that was my problem in All-Stars.
I know I’m not just gonna blindly trust anyone.
With a million dollars, a pirate is very happy to adjust in Indiana.
No more sleeping on the bamboo and killing myself, the mattress that we had was a hand-me-down, hand-me-down.
I got a new washer and dryer; I have a wonderful dishwasher; I have a guy who mows the lawn.
Choices has stood with me for years when I was on my own, doing my own kids' group, and it about bankrupted me.
Choices stepped in, helped me out, gave me kids through the Department of Education and the Department of Corrections, and it was a good match-up.
And I always said I'd be with them as long as I could.
This makes it so I can be with them forever.
She has retired to help me with the fan mail and the charity requests that we get and then dealing with our charity, Rupert's Kids.
You know, after doing all that and setting my daughter up with the college fund where she can go anywhere in the world when she turns 18, no matter what happens to Laura and I, and paying the government, you know, a million dollars goes very quickly.
I'm making sure that Laura and Raya and I all do
live happily ever after with helping my little group of people around me too.
So it's amazingly good.
There's a few different things out there that we're talking about doing.
I'm trying to get back on TV.
As long as I can go out there and be myself.
I want to be able to be myself, because I know I'm not an actor.
I'm just me.
From the time I made my audition tape, I believed in my heart it was my time to win.
This is definitely a pirate adventure.
When I heard there was a pirate theme on "Survivor" seven, I fully believed that 400 years ago, I was one of the pirates out here.
The treasure I was never able to go back for.
My tribe saw me as Blackbeard.
We were going to cut my hair and beard.
And I was going to be Blackbeard.
After two days, my pants have still not dried.
That second day was probably the hardest day ever.
I actually begged for a dress.
After I made that dress, Burton and Shawn and Michelle had a hey day with me.
I did not like the first part of the game.
It was my hardest time ever.
They wanted the power.
Making fun of me in front of others was their downfall.
The one saving grace was, I had the ocean.
I honestly loved going fishing.
I wasn't the greatest of shots when I first started.
But I could still bring a sack of fish home.
I know I was bringing enough food home that when my tribe found the treasure, they were pissed.
The hardest was being away from my wife and kid and the next was being around people I could not trust.
I try very hard every day to show trust and compassion in hopes that they will learn.I tried to play this game with honesty and it was not returned.
I could not believe I would be voted out.
I thought there was no way in the world that could happen.
So we start voting.
And I believe that it's Darrah.
The first three votes were two for Darrah and one for Jon.
Then the next vote is for Rupert.
And I'm thinking, 'Could this be?'
And then the second vote for Rupert and a third and I just put my head down and thought 'Oh my God.
This is the end.
At least for 27 days, I showed that I could survive and I could help others.
I – survivor - no matter where I am, no matter what I have, and no matter I do.
I showed that I have some strength, that I have some worth.
I was hoping, even though I knew there was not much of a chance, the toughest old man I have ever met in my life, Rudy Bosch.
We had a great time when we played on All Stars all those years ago.
The one I was really excited to see,  but I never got a chance to play with, was Tyson.
When we played on Heroes and Villains together he was on the villain’s tribe and he should have been on the heroes side.
There is 400 Survivors out there and everybody talks and we all would love to play the game again.
I tell people all the time, never set up any alliances before you get out there as you don’t know what they are going to do to us once we get out there.
You don’t know who team you are going to be on, what is going to be happening.
I always like to go out there fresh and seeing who is on my tribe and in those first few days building that strong alliance.
I am that one who is known to build four or five people strong and make it all the way to the end.
Candice and I, our relationship is rocky at best.
She is not happy with me and I am not very happy with anything that girl does.
I have watched her go against her tribe many times.
I knew I was going to have trouble with those two.
Gervase, who was there on the very first Survivor, I always wanted to play with him.
Tyson, Aras and Monica – there was some very strong players that were all about my age.
I think we would have done very well together.
The one thing we did see on Redemption Island was Candice and I first and our first conversation.
I was working on the shelter and the roof, so we would have protection from the rain and sun.
I looked at her and I said “I am doing this for me, but you are going to benefit from it.
There is only one of us to make it out of Redemption Island and don’t look to me to take care of everybody out here as I am going to take care of myself, as I want to be the one to come out of here.” I was not going to help someone else get out of there.
We lived together on Heroes and Villains and she was used to me doing all the work and the hunting, making the fire and the gathering of firewood.
I was not going to do that on Redemption Island.
On the tribe I would do that in a minute.
I liked playing back in Survivor 7 and 8 when like on All Stars they threw us out there with the clothes on our back and said good luck.
We went four or five days without fire before we finally were able to make fire.
We went days without food as there were not rations of rice.
I liked the game back then a little more.
It was more “survivor”.
Now giving them tools and hammers, nails and saws we would have to battle and win that in a challenge.
When I played there was no hidden immunity idols or Redemption Island they just threw sixteen strangers out there and you  played the game.
If you find it or catch it you can have it.
If you don’t make it you don’t get it.
If we went back to the old ways that would mean I would never get to play again but I still love the old ways of Survivor.
When they started talking to us they told Laura and I that we would be playing the game together.
I know they have been known to say one thing and do another.
Laura and I talked about that, and how this could put us in a situation where we have to decide between each other or our alliances.
This could be detrimental to our relationship or it could  be very empowering.
We wanted to make sure that the game that it made our relationship stronger and it has.
We talked more about the mental and social game.
I wish we had gone out to get a machete and had her practising with the machete.
She can use a flint and steel.
Before the game she had a little bit of practice but now she is great with the flint.
We spent most of our time talking about the social side and the physical side.
The pain, it is hard to see how much pain you go through in that game.
It can wear you down worse then anything.
Once you start feeling that pain you start getting a little more hard to live with.
The ones that are hard to live with are usually the first ones out.
I wish we had spent more time on the activities.
I would do Survivor again in a second.
Even Laura has been bitten by the Survivor bug where she says “Maybe I would even play again”.
I told Laura if we go out there together again don’t expect her to give my game up for her anymore.
Not at all.
I was thrilled I was able to rescue and protect my wife but I don’t want to do that again.
Laura and I would love to go on The Amazing Race.
We love travelling seeing different sights and experiencing different cultures.
As we're out playing the game, I'm sitting, waiting to see who's coming out next and I'm only hoping it's not Laura.
Almost every time that I've ever left Survivor, I've said, 'That was the hardest trip I've ever had in my life, I'm never playing that game again!'
And then as days go by, 'Well, I could do it.'
And then I start hoping that they call and ask me to play the game again.
When they called and asked, 'Do you want to play the game?'
I was thrilled.
But then they said they wanted me to play with a loved one.
Right off the bat, I suggested going with my wife, not playing with my brother, or my cousin.
I never really thought about having people coming at me or try and get me through Laura.
Each time I've been out on Survivor, except the very first time, just when you get out there, I just get in, putting in all the work.
I'll do the food, I'll clean the food.
I never really thought about that.
I should have.
Plus, not being on the same tribe and them being able to get at me through Laura.
But we came together and I had to protect her.
As we're out playing the game, I'm sitting, waiting to see who's coming out next and I'm only hoping it's not Laura.
Well, one of my buddies who's not married was giving me a hard time, saying, 'That was pretty pitiful strategy.'
And I told him, 'Depends what you're looking at — what the game is.'
In the game of life, that was great strategy.
Of course, any time that I can take care of my wife and help her out of with trouble, help her into a place with a little more safety and security — I hope I'm able to do that.
I knew that would mean my safety was more in trouble, but I would make the same decision every time.
Since my wife has gotten back from playing the game, I asked if she would enter the game again.
I heard her say, 'Yes,' she would enter the game again.
'We would both enter the game again.
But don't expect me to give up my game for you.'
One of the ways that I was able to be a winner was that I was the winner of a giant fan vote.
I never really won the game, I came close every time, except for this one, to getting to the end of the game.
I'm the only guy out there who spent 100 days in three games.
There are two females that got 100 days but being able to go out there and make the decision to give up the game for my wife, to see how tough she is and how good she is doing, oh my gosh, I love seeing that but it was tough.
I always had a lot of tie-dye.
When my wife and I were newlywed, she got a whole ball of my white shirts — my white tank tops that I used to wear during work.
I had a lot of white tank tops.
She went and tie-dyed all of them to eliminate the stains.
So I went from wearing a few tie-dyes to wearing a lot of tie-dye.
I never really thought of myself of having strong political views.
In a few years when I run for Governor, I've just been fed up with some of the decisions made by legislation that isn't proven to be working.
With Survivor, that helped get my political voice, working with my mentoring program to help change my little community here in Indianapolis.
Being able to run for Governor, show my kids in my mentoring program that you can change your world, you do deserve second chances, that it is okay to be yourself.
Those were some great lessons that I've learned myself and a few others.
It'll be a few years before I ever run for any other office.
I'm sure I will again.
But that's one heck of an undertaking.
I'd need to recoup and regather.
My mentoring program is opening another offshoot in another community about ten miles outside of Indianapolis.
We'll bring the vocational training back to high schools, help bring productive re-entry programs with actual work into the detention centers, we lessen the recidivism rate, raise the success rates of high school graduate and through that, limit spending, show how we can do that with resources that we have in the community if we work together.
If we can do that in smaller little microcosms, like a community of 40,000 or 50,000 people, then we might spend a few million dollars a year on this system, but we're spending a few billion dollars locking people up.
It's a little harder to see that saving in a smaller community, but maybe we can really start changing the numbers and showing what we're doing.
We better come up with some changes in this administration soon and in how we treat this problem.
That’s what I think hurt so much, was I let myself believe ever since the rock in my pocket.
But oh my gosh, I wouldn’t be able to actually manipulate this to make it to the final three.
When the three girls all went out on their reward challenge and left Russell with us, I talked to him and said, “These girls are going to get you, Russell; the only way you can guarantee getting to the final three is with Colby and I.” And I meant it.
I would have loved to have taken Russell to the final three.
That’s why I say it was a last-ditch effort.
The lie and the rock in my pocket wasn’t working anymore, and I couldn’t get anybody to stand on my side.
You know, Jeff -- I don’t know what to say about Jeff.
He called me out in tribal council and said what a silly player I was and said I’d never win the game if I didn’t become more conniverish.
And I looked at him and said I’d win the same way I won last time.
I was also going through the game with broken toes.
I was the first person to ever go through the game like that.
Going through that was so much pain.
Every time you took a step on something uneven, you’d feel the pain spike all the way through your foot up into your head.
Even my daughter looked at me after one of the episodes and said, “Oh, Daddy, you looked a little mean.” I said, “baby, I am in pain.”
On day two when my tribe looked at me and sat me out of an immunity challenge, looking at me [and] saying Cirie is tougher than you are, I thought there was no way of sitting out of another challenge.
My team is not ever going to see me as weak.
I stopped talking and thinking about my toe, but unfortunately it didn’t stop hurting.
If I was chopping wood all night long, I would have had to have a whole lot more wood than a couple of logs.
The tribe was a bunch of lazy people that did very little work.
I would gather wood all day, and they would burn it up all day long.
After I chopped up the wood at night, the next day, not one person ever said a word about me bothering them at night.
They all came to me in the middle of the night and kept warm and thanked me for having fire.
I think Jerri just needed someone to vent at.
In “Survivor,” you have different forms of aggression.
You have different game-playing out there -- where somebody like Russell is manipulating everybody around him and making them insanely mad and somebody like Parvati is doing the exact same thing but no one’s mad at her.
It’s all in how you do it and what you do.
But yes, every person out there is looking at everyone else thinking how they can get them out.
It’s a lot of passive-aggressive playing.
After a few hours of search for the idol and I saw nobody -- everybody was still out looking and nobody had said that they had found it.
So when two or three hours had gone by, I wanted to make sure that I had some kind of protection to go to tribal council.
That’s when I said, this is my last chance.
I’ll grab a hold of a rock, I’ll touch it in my pocket.
I always made sure that I had my bag with me or empty, in case they were trying to search my stuff.
I would touch it every once in a while in my pocket, like you do with your cellphone to make sure you still have it.
And then I looked at Russell and said, “I feel comfortable now, I’m gonna take a nap.” I would never have napped in “Survivor.”
I think until after that first tribal council when I went through and Jeff said, “play your idol” and I fiddled around and crossed my legs.
When I got back to camp, they started asking me, and I looked right at them and said, “I’m glad I didn’t waste an immunity idol.” I never said I had one, I just said I was glad I didn’t waste one.
After Danielle was voted out, I think Sandra told Parvati.
In my world, I like being considered one of the good guys.
Even after I won the million bucks, I gave most of it away.
I like showing that it counts how you play the game.
My philosophy and Russell’s philosophies are about as extremely opposite as you can possibly imagine.
He thinks about what he can get out of people and how he can benefit from them, and I look at people as how we can help them be better and help them improve their whole world.
Being around Russell -- such an evil, arrogant person -- it took a little bit to hold my tongue.
I use that in my mentoring program -- when you use and abuse and manipulate people, you can’t turn around and think anybody is going to respect you.
If you do, you are sadly mistaken because that is not the way of this world.
Russell understand half of the game, but he doesn’t understand the social game.
Colby is our last hero standing.
I hope he can make it to the end and convince those ladies to keep him instead of Russell, but the odds are against him.
I say it all the time: If James hadn’t been hurt, Colby would never had made it so far.
I respect Parvati’s game because Parvati and Sandra both are playing a very manipulative, socially acceptable game and both of them have been targeted from the start.
It’s so good to talk to you.
I’ve been watching you on TV for years!
It’s crazy that after being on Survivor four times, I’m the first one out!
I hope they do!
That would be wonderful.
When they asked me to play Survivor again, but that I had to bring a loved one, I did not even give them Laura’s name because the game is so hard, the game hurts you, the game beats you down.
I gave producers the names of my brother, my cousin and my niece.
Then a week went by and Laura said, “Why didn’t you give them my name, I want to play!” I wanted it to be Laura’s choice, I was worried about her but as you’ve seen, she’s pretty darn tough.
When we were talking about playing the game, she talked to me about not trusting everyone like I usually do.
And I talked to her about using the strategy of “anybody but me.” That’s how Sandra won the game twice.
Just like the loved ones that voted her out, I think there are a few people on the returning tribe that I have a big of a history with.
There’s Tina, who I voted out first in Survivor: All Stars.
Tyson and I were against each other in Heroes vs. Villains and I know that he’s still got a bitter taste in his mouth.
I’m just hoping that Laura can get in there and show that she’s a good worker and tough in the challenges.
She’s a better swimmer, runner and puzzle-maker than I am.
Ever since the first Survivor, I’ve been in love with Survivor.
Just like I got to play with Rudy Boesch, the toughest old man I’ve ever met, I wanted to play with Gervais!
He was on the very Survivor, that’s what made me fall in love with Survivor.
I wanted to play the game with Tina, knowing I had to make it up to her, knowing I voted her out first last time.
I would have really liked playing more with Tyson.
Most of my days are spent on my mentoring program, Rupert’s Kids.
We are teaching young men how to make a living, have a sense of self-worth and work ethic.
We do a lot of landscaping and then in the winter time, we rebuild housing projects.
It teaches them how to be electricians, plumbers, carpenters, framers and painters.
We teach real life skills.
I love spending my day like that.
Laura is going to have to show the returning players tribe that she is tough.
They’re going to be hard on her.
They’re going to expect her to take my place, if she can do that and also play social-side and be a worker bee, then she’ll have a great chance!
I never would have thought swimming with my clothes on would have been so hard, but it was.
With my big denim jeans, my legs were rubber.
It took all I had to keep kicking and getting it to shore.
I was spent, and it hadn't even started yet.
When I got to those stairs, I was done.
We sit the sucker down, and I needed to rest.
The other team, Morgan, came up, sat their stuff down next to us, and all left.
This is definitely a pirate adventure.
Pirates pillage, pirates steal, pirates take advantage.
If they were gonna be silly enough to put it right next to me, I'm gonna put it in my thing.
All their trade goods, all the little women's shoes, the insoles.
Everything that I could find in theirs, I took.
I've always said I will lie, cheat and steal to win this game.
There was my stealing.
I stole for the Drake.
We are pirates, so we pirated.
Shawn is being a pain in the butt!
We're a strong little team, but the dynamic duo there that are posturing for the lead role need to be a little more careful because they're going to make everybody hate them.
Jon, he reminds me of my boys who I mentor who just pop off stupid stuff.
You know, talk about getting some honey, or… smoking something, drinking something.
I'm wearing my fancy-- my dress jeans.
Suckers were thick and hard and heavy.
And them pants killed my crotch where nice wet denim rubs for a day and a half and just starts eating that skin away.
I got the little teasing and laughing with the girls as we made it and I put it on and I looked really silly.
It's done.
I'm wearing a dress.
I'm never gonna put them pants back on.
It feels great to be able to catch food, but I knew that one fish just wasn't going to be enough, so I took the spear.
So, I start catching fish.
After I got that, I thought, "Okay, some more. Some more."
I was thrilled.
I've never seen a saltwater catfish.
I didn't know they made such an animal.
I got to the point where I thought I was going to get eight of them.
Everybody was going to get their own fish.
I didn't get eight, but we got us fish.
I had a great day.
I don't know if I can keep up the workload that I'm putting on myself, but that's what I told myself I was going to do.
I'm coming out here to be the caretaker.
I'm trying to make these people believe that there is no way you can get along without me, and I think I'm doing it.
When I turned around and saw them idiots bouncing around naked in the mud, in the muck, in the stickers, in the thorns… (chuckles) it was hilarious.
I am loving life and loving this place and loving the position I'm in.
I am in paradise.
What more do I want?
I'm living in a bounty of food.
I've got beautiful souls around me.
And I've got some help being strong.
People are not truly lazy per se.
People are having a hard time in paradise.
I love being in the middle of a gigantic fish tank.
I love being able to go out and, in a couple of hours, bring a sack of fish home.
It's more of a pain in the ass for me to give him my spear and worry about it being lost or being, you know, broken or whatever where I and then I will be in trouble because that's my food.
I need to eat meat.
The current was so strong, and it was throwing him into the rocks, and-- now, remember this is in our little inlet where it's a bathtub.
He couldn't find the spearhead.
He gives up.
My spear is gone, the head is gone.
There's no more meat.
There's no more meat.
They're talking about tying the damn fork off to it.
He could not even tell me where he lost it at.
So I go out and I-I start doing a grid pattern.
I start from the trees, start from where I know he wasn't, and on my grid pattern, I'd do about a size of a football field.
You're looking at a general area that's five or six football fields.
I feel better.
I stopped yelling and screaming at him and cussing at him and calling him bad names.
I know finding that spear made him feel better.
If we hadn't have found the spear, he, for sure, would have been done, done, done.
Our tribe went out half-cocked.
I played into that for a while, too, until l started thinking about it.
Pirates were not idiots, and people are not idiots, and you don't bury things in the sand that you don't want to be washed back up.
If their pot is the only water cleaning source they have, my God, l feel terrible about taking it.
But l have to remind myself, we are pirates and this is our game.
And Drake is the power to be reckoned with.
You know, l don't know, I turned around and Burton's pointing at my ass and laughing at me and just being an idiot.
You know, it's like high school.
The-the pretty boy jock-ass idiots all got to pick on me.
When Burt comes to me and says, "We're going to get rid of some of our Drakes..." as soon as he said that, I wanted to smack him and say, you know, "Traitor."
If this was a pirate culture, he'd already be dead.
My alliance is interested in throwing the challenge to cut out a little bit of cancer in our tribe: namely, Burton.
In that, l can sit out on a challenge.
I already told them that, if l'm in a challenge, there's no way in hell that l would lose.
Throwing a challenge is the stupidest thing that Drake could ever do.
But will l stand back and let them do it?
Yes, if that's what they want to do.
When I first got to the Morgan camp, the beach was pounding away at their shelter.
The surf is coming up, and they don't realize that, as the moon is changing, the tide's going to raise another two or three feet.
And they're using logs to try and stop the tide from taking their shelter away.
It's not going to work.
These guys work very hard at not working.
They fight and argue and bicker and bitch amongst each other so much that I know why it takes them hours to do anything.
I know why they don't really do great in the challenges.
I know why they're not really a great team.
I've been dying of thirst since I've been here.
I've been hungry since I've been here.
Maybe, at least for lunch, I can get a-a belly full of fish.
I'm hoping to take Ryan out there, and I'll swim around with him and just kind of be his buddy and see if he can go catch a fish.
Ryno?
Nice young kid, very willing to learn, wanting to be the provider.
Not knowing how to do the providing.
Willing to learn on the spear.
Willing to go out with me.
I'm very comfortable with him.
We had one beautiful one that was almost in the bag, and… Ryan lost it, and… I screamed real loud at him, and… I feel bad for him.
I love being back home.
When Jeff said, "You can enjoy your bounty or go home," there wasn't even a question.
I didn't look back.
I come home.
I didn't need to go share in the loot.
I need to go bond with my tribe.
I poured two more bowls full of rice in his bag, and he was happy.
That truly was not a looting.
That was friends helping friends.
There is probably a lot of danger in being too much in control of both tribes.
Who knows what my own tribe even thinks of me, but if I push too hard, I will end up alienating someone.
Michelle feels like she is going.
She is trying to make a plea that she works as hard, if not harder, than Shawn, and she eats lots less.
She never takes more than her share.
She swayed me enough that I will mention it to others.
Do we want to take Shawn out of this game?
It's Day 15-- he was our first pick on Day 2.
“We welcome back this guy.”
Morgan returned to camp in high spirits with rain ponchos, a cooking pot, and a chance to get clean.
My first Tribal Council sucked.
I was mad and l was tired.
I was pissed off.
I didn't want to be there.
They still do not see that we gave Morgan some great momentum.
They don't see that.
For a while, everybody knew a Drake was gonna win this.
Now, there is question.
This morning, I went and checked on Balboa.
He was dead.
I am very irritated with Shawn.
I want him off my island and out of my adventure.
I can't believe that Jon and Trish are trying to get me out before even the merge.
We do not even know when the merge is going to be, and they're trying to get me out.
(voting for Trish) I cannot believe that you turned on me so quickly.
Everybody in my tribe tells me that you want me out, and you lie right to my face.
I can't take that.
At Tribal Council, I dodged the biggest cannonball aimed right at me.
I knew when I saw two "Ruperts" in the vote, that Trish and Jon were against me.
I was ready to kill Jon, and literally grab that little scrawny ass by the neck and pop his head off him like a (expletive censor) chicken.
I'm not saying Jon is finished yet.
But… (sighs) I'm not saying that I believe him at all anymore.
I don't believe a damn word he says.
Jonny Fairplay is Jonny Pain-In-The-Ass now to me.
My tribe, they have it in their heads that we're going to a new island and having a big party and going to go with Morgans and be in a merge.
If it happens, okay.
But I'm not looking forward to it, because I have a strong tribe right now.
I do not want to merge yet.
And I cannot plan on a merge yet.
I don't feel vulnerable tonight.
I have my three.
I'm not vulnerable tonight.
The two other guys in the tribe are vulnerable.
Jon wrote my name down last night, and fair is fair.
I should write Jon's name down tonight, but I haven't decided yet.
Amazingly enough, Burton shows up in a good mood, happy to be here, full of enthusiasm and life and just pumped Drake back up-- bang!, immediately.
I wanted to look him in the eye and say, "This is why I agreed to vote you out."
I didn't like the way that he treated me in the start of this game, and that hurt me and I wanted him to know that that hurt me.
I portray a very strong and independent person, but, in my head, I'm that fat little terrified kid that was picked on in school all his life.
And I saw Burton being those son of a bitches that would make fun of me.
Within two minutes of talking, all fears were subsided, all hesitation was gone.
Everything was good.
As soon as you think you got the game figured out, they say, "Throw your buffs down, and you're all in one tribe."
We're now going to be the Balboas, which I love, you know?
That's my snake's name.
And it's so nice to have new people in our home.
The feast was great.
I got some ribs, a big old hunk of lamb.
We were trying to figure out how we could turn one Morgan against the others, and we find that little Lill already kind of resented them for voting her out.
I hope that all of the former Morgans, now Balboas, feel comfortable enough to eat as much as they want.
I like that feeling of being able to fill you up and make you feel comfortable.
I mean, I'm looking at these guys.
Their body-- they're just emaciated from lack of food.
It's sad.
It would be nice to go to Tribal Council, get rid of Ryan, who is one of the-- one of the leaders of the week.
Ryan has the potential to band T and Darrah and maybe suck Jon and Burton in and give them five people that they could just-- they could steamroll over all of us… over Sandra, Christa, I, and Lill.
Now will they do that?
I hope to God, no.
(voting for Ryan O) I'm sorry we weren't on the same team.
I know you would have been good with me.
I would trade you for a bunch of my guys, but it's your time to go.
Nighttime is my one bad time.
If I could go just 39 days and never have to sleep, I would make this beautifully.
But nighttime is killing me.
At night out here, I start thinking about family.
That's when I miss my family.
I tell Laura, my wife, all my woes and sorrows, all my triumphs.
I tell Laura everything.
And I want for everyone to see I am the best damn Survivor that has ever been.
I am it.
I know they will.
Shouldn't think that way, I know.
I know. I know. I know.
I hear you. I hear you.
Take it down to the one or two people that I truly, really care about.
I care about Sandra and Christa.
They care about me.
It's very hard keeping mentally aware of everything that's going on around here.
I try to guide everything that goes on on my island.
I try to direct everyone's actions while keeping myself grounded and aware of what is going on and what I am doing, not settling ever for anything but first.
And letting everybody here realize that they are finishing in places of honor.
To build them up to be a winner and still lose… that's a hard mental battle.
I have to go out and get fish.
I would love it if I was a mean-ass son of a bitch and just went out and got fish for myself.
But, so, what are you going to do?
You go out and get fish.
A shark appears, and I'm like, "Ah, I want him.
I want him, bad!"
But, the only way I'm taking that shot is if I can get directly over him, hit him straight down in the head and hold that spear into him.
Because, if not, he's going to be gone with my spear.
I almost had a four-foot gray reef shark.
My God, I sure did want that shark.
I love being the baddest hunter out there.
I never give up, I never surrender, I never admit defeat.
The deal between Burton and I, after I had given him my bacon, my breakfast, my wonderful breakfast… he said he owed me, and he would pay me back with the next challenge he wins.
Burton promised me.
It's fine.
It keeps unity between he and I.
It's a deal.
It keeps unity in our group.
When Burton gave that away to Jon, and Lill kept it in her hand without even thinking about it, that showed me that… I might not be as secure as I am-- as I think I am.
Got to find out what's going on.
My only hope is when Lill comes back, she looks me in the eye and tells me what Jon is talking about.
When Jon and Lill came back from their catamaran, I just sucked Lill in quickly and told her, "You stick with me and you could be top two."
You know, "It could be you and me."
I tried to figure out what Jon was talking to her about and if Jon was going to try and suck her in and get her in some kind of alliance.
And she said "No."
I know now that Lill will be wholehearted with me.
I wanted to hug and kiss her.
The Immunity Challenge pissed the hell out of me.
I know I was clearly the best dart-blower there.
And they knocked me out so damn quick.
My own team, Burton and Sandra, knocked me out.
Sandra truly was a mistake.
I don't blame her at all.
Burton, he knew what the hell he was doing.
Darrah is still acting like she's ready to go and packing and saying her good-byes.
But that could all be an act.
Luckily, I have Lill on my side, I have Sandra on my side and I have Christa on my side.
Lill has been the key figure in a lot of votes lately.
If they've turned and they've gotten Darrah, T, Jon and Burton together on one side, I've got my four on my side and we will have a tie.
A Morgan has to go tonight.
And the other two work harder than you do.
It is insane how bad I needed this.
This would have made my life a lot better.
I always get hurt trusting people.
I want so badly to be accepted and I never get the acceptance that I want.
I don't fit.
So much for my dreams.
I would hope that Lill and Sandra appreciate where they are.
Win or lose, they should appreciate the situation that they have been given… and earned.
The significance of tonight is going to be life-changing for one person.
A million dollars is going to be life-changing.
We are going to take one little housewife, one little mama, and make their lives, their husbands' lives and their kids' lives different.
Sandra, I am so happy for you. You deserve it.
From the first day, when we were blood brother and sister, I was just thrilled to have somebody on my side.
I'm glad I can be there for you now. I hope you win.
I am the new guy on the block, you know?
All these people know each other.
Right now I'm just trying to stand back and let all these egos decide what we do, and I'll be the worker bee.
New strategy for a new game.
Man, we are all dying of thirst. And we need fire.
We need to be able to boil water.
We could be like Rudy and just grab the water and drink it, but none of us want to die.
Rudy looks at me and the first time he sees me, you know, all tie-dyed and hippie, he looked right through it and wanted to be my buddy.
Rudy is a man of few words, but from what I gathered, he's a man of honor.
If he and I stick together, if we can just make it through these first few days, he and I will stick together through the end of the game.
You got Jerri and Jenna on one side saying, "We got to get rid of the winners."
I got Tina and Ethan in the other side saying, "You cannot trust Jerri and Jenna, you cannot trust them."
I think I might have some control over Rudy's vote.
He and I are going to stick together.
Coming back from Tribal Council without fire was devastating.
With Tina gone... pouring rain, dying of thirst... them thinking that we're going to bring fire home.
So we leave a pot of water-- of well water, contaminated water-- in the pot instead of an open, empty pot to catch rain water is a bad way to end Day 3.
This is showing me that I'm not, you know, I thought I was an outdoors man, and I am... with a lighter.
Rudy is most definitely a hero.
More so than any other person here, he deserves to be here.
Seventy five years old and doing... (tearfully) I can't...
It's killing me to be here.
I'm not writing Rudy's name down.
I know that-- I'm not writing Rudy's name down.
Ethan, you're tough.
Rudy and I made a pact, and I am not voting for Rudy.
I gotta vote for you, Ethan.
I don't know exactly what has got into the tribe.
This morning, they want to do stuff.
It's a little bit of missing Rudy, a little bit of guilt, a little everything.
There's a lot of nervous energy.
And it's getting everybody going.
As soon as I brought the fish back, Ethan's grabbing his spear and running out there.
I tried to tell him it's not a competition.
It's really not.
I like being the fisherman.
I know he wants to be, too, but it can't be a competition between he and I.
It will just hurt his emotions.
It will hurt the whole camp.
That's what beat us at the challenge yesterday.
We weren't working together.
If we can keep this harmony up, we will be a strong little tribe.
Even though we're little, we are gonna be mighty.
I'm a rehabber by trade, and that's what I do is work on houses.
So I told my tribe we're building a log cabin.
We're going to dig down into the sand a couple feet to add to our height, so you walk into it and you'll be able to stand up.
That's what I want.
I have a hard time standing back and listening to a bunch of people say, "It's too much work.
It can't get done.” Everybody's... "I can't do it."
Everybody, everybody.
All three of them.
He walked around, and everything that was loose, he touched, and I saw it in his face when we walked down into the hut.
He didn't like down.
I'm trying like crazy to talk to him.
He doesn't really have anything to do with us, and he's ready to go.
And then I see him tell Jeff, “Water go down in. Bad.”
Our beach is destroyed.
That stupid shelter that I built is destroyed.
Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea I've ever had in my life.
And we paid dearly tonight for it.
It's now underwater, and we are homeless.
And I got to build us another shelter today, something today.
That storm was insanely hard.
It was rough this morning, it was rough last night.
If Jerri warms up and feels better and soaks a little of daylight in her, she'll be fine, too.
But the plan today is, we got to make shelter, we got to make fire, and we got to get it together now.
We got some sleep last night in that new shelter.
It was nice to get a few hours uninterrupted, relaxing sleep.
We all feel... at least 100% better than yesterday morning.
I feel very good about the raft.
I'm trying to not think about the house.
You know, I got my reputation riding on this damn thing again.
We came up with a good design, and with four paddles, we should be able to fly.
We want to win.
Their camp is...  compared to our camp, our camp was Hobo Junction.
Theirs is the Taj Mahal.
The role of provider is wide open here.
I like the fact that none of them could fish.
A few of them would eat the-the snails that attach to the sides of the rock, but I want to be the guy that brings, you know, a couple of dozen oysters and a couple fish in every day.
Sue is playing her own game.
She wants to be that provider, but the only meat that she's providing right now are those cone snails, which, I think, most of the people eat.
Sue was distant, non-responsive, throwing in the towel.
Uh, at the time of the challenge and all the (exhales) contact and all that with Richard... Sue could have handled it different.
She could have stopped right then and said, "Foul."
Instead, she turns her head, says, "Oh, that's gross," and goes on.
Thinks about it, processes it, comes up with her own agenda... and goes on with that.
When I first started this Survivor: All-Star, and I hear people talking, and you know, saying that they want to help me, or saying that they want me on their side, I couldn't trust any of them.
Now after 16 days, I know that I can trust Jenna.
I hope that I can trust Rob and Amber.
I feel pretty confident with where I'm at.
Sue is Sue.
She will endure and pursue her own agenda.
She doesn't give a damn about what anybody else is doing.
Ultimately, Sue having her own agenda will hinder her.
She's-- it alienates her from the tribe.
With Richard getting voted off, Sue walking out and losing the challenge, three strikes, Chapera was almost out for a few minutes.
We all promised each other we'd stick together no matter what.
What that really means, I don't know, but it's a good gesture, and it's a good show of faith.
My goal before our challenge was to pound that into 'em, even if we get behind, we stay calm, we stay focused, and we try hard.
We'll win, guaranteed, if we keep our composure and we try hard.
There's burgers this thick and dogs and brats and lettuce and cucumbers and salad and asparagus and corn on the cob and salty, greasy, beautiful food.
I've been waiting 20 days to not have to poke fish with a stick.
I'm going to be the hunter tomorrow.
I hope I see that big six-foot shark.
I hope I see that yellowfin tuna.
I hope I see that grouper that's this big.
If Rob and Amber are not playing kissy face, sucky, kissy face yet, they are gonna be soon.
Um, I have walked up on them in the middle of the night where they just looked so guilty it's not even funny, and I know something's going on.
Sometimes...
I really like Boston Rob.
Other times I see kind of an arrogant pain in the ass.
You know, he wants to be the man.
Tom and I are definitely the worker bees on Chapera.
I am not happy for anybody to lay their ass around in the shelter and let me do all the work, but...
I can't go in there and say, "Get your ass out of that bed and go to work."
I can't say that.
Big Tom did get him a little fish.
Not a bad fish for his first fish ever on the spear.
That probably hits in the goldfish category.
That's a fish tank fish... but Big Tom got it, and he was thrilled.
I have not had a reward ever in my Survivor history.
And I took two gorgeous girls.
It was a great reward.
I sat down to dinner with Amber and Jenna who were dolled up to the nines, beautiful lips.
I wanted to kiss and hug 'em all over.
No matter how it turns out, when we get home, I have wholehearted faith in Amber and Rob and Jenna and Big Tom and I.
Five strong, solid.
Our fire pit is in a lake, in a little stream.
It's freezing cold and soaking wet.
Make it through the night (coughs) but... in hopes that when the sun came up, it'd be better.
When the sun came up, it was still bad; it was worse.
It's just uplifting.
I like it that my wife and daughter think I'm the toughest, baddest son of a bitch out there... even though I'm not.
I like that, though.
That gives me strength.
I'll read it a thousand times in next 11 days.
You know, that's almost a challenge I wish I didn't win.
This is what killed me on Pearl Islands was...
I let the pecking order be known, and then I was the next one gone.
This adventure is geared to create hard feelings between people.
I hate being that person that creates the hard feelings.
When I came out of the ocean, I realized that nobody was going to help me clean fish.
But they all want to eat the fish.
I'm feeling used and abused.
If somebody comes up and asks which fish is theirs, I will probably tell them the one that they caught and the one that they cleaned.
My little Jenna had the nerve to bitch at me about putting one of my fish on the grill.
She's just getting really a pain in the ass, and I'm very sorry that I have an alliance with her.
Today, Bo and Mike came back from their little, uh, adventure with Big Tom and Rob.
As soon as they came in, instead of letting them sit down and rest and enjoy their visit here, we put them to work, got them started, you know, helping us out at camp.
I took Bo out spearfishing.
Big Tom wanted him to spearfish badly, and I wasn't even going to give Bo a spear.
You know, I, uh, I kind of protect those spears.
Even though I don't talk about it, I protect those spears.
This is hard fishing, you know, Bo wasn't the greatest swimmer.
He was using the spear to propel himself more than to fish.
As we were fishing, I look at Bo's spear, and the head of it's gone.
I had my flashbacks to when Shawn lost his spear tip in Pearl Islands.
I'm not as worried about it because I've got my spear that is now going to be considered mine.
They want to keep eating, they will let me use the damn spear.
The weather is terrible and it rains every day.
The shelter is pitiful and it leaks every night.
Every one of us stink like rotten dogs.
The challenges are going to become more mental, more physical, more stressful.
Camp life is hard, and as it gets down to the last few days, it's getting harder every day.
Jenna and I were gathering our coconuts and sitting down, celebrating, cracking open green coconuts and toasting to our victory over the darn coconut trees.
When Jenna said, "...and we have to beat Rob in immunity," I looked over and my heart sank because Rob was standing right there.
It was a little scary situation.
Jenna already is full of paranoia and I don't need Rob to be full of paranoia.
Paranoia will destroy ya.
They won a car apiece.
They brought back pockets full of candy, and split them up into five piles.
They took their share after eating dogs and candy.
(imitating Amber) "I saved my candy."
Well, it's easy to save your damn candy when you've got a belly full... and a new car!
If there is a Survivor hex that keeps the car winners from winning the game, I would love that.
That would be my little justice.
And I win the million.
If we want to have a fire at all, we're going to have to have some wood.
After a while, I'll go get us some fish.
This is the first night with not very much sleep and very little help.
It makes me crazy to watch Rob and Amber sit on their butts, and then when challenge comes up, they have amazing amounts of energy.
If I get Tom in with Jenna and I, we three would be the power in this five and put Rob and Amber out of this game.
Rob is playing this game so hard now.
I know that that was all a ploy to try and make me look bad.
That's fine.
I stood up, I told Big Tom what's what.
We just got back from Day 36's Tribal Council, where we voted Big Tom's butt out of here.
This morning's breakfast is good-bye to one of us.
Somebody is leaving tonight.
Boy, I hope it's not me.
My fate rests on the honor of a 26-year-old single mama who really, really wants to win badly.
I can't see Jenna going against me, and I don't want to go against Jenna.
She's just a little paranoid.
You got to let her alone.
She's just a young girl.
She's fine.
I believe that she will write Rob's name down.
(voting for Rob M.) I don't know what else to say.
I hope we both have two votes and I hope we go into a tie.
I am a little angry at Jenna.
Greed won out over friendship.
Almost disgusted me.
There's not one person in this game that can say I lied to them, that I played conniving.
I did my best.
I honestly had a very, very good experience with Survivor All-Stars.
I came out here to take care of myself and everyone around me, and I did.
I might not have won one damn Immunity Challenge, but I won a few rewards.
I enjoyed myself, I shared, I cared and I actually had fun.
I am returning to Survivor for my fourth time.
Now it's time for Laura.
Watching my wife walk over to the other tribe, it was a little bit of a relief, and a little bit of sadness at the same time.
I didn't have to worry at all about writing my wife's name down.
But then, I also can't protect her.
Watching my wife get voted out of her tribe about killed me.
Why they would do that, it's a-- it's a smack against me.
That is everyone of those little scared newbies saying we've gotta stop Rupert.
I put myself in a position where I am not safe.
It's killing me.
But I would rather have myself in this position than I would my wife.
Laura deserves to play the game.
In Laura and I's world, blood is thicker than anything.
And Laura and I are blood.
If I can battle my ass off Redemption Island and Laura is still there, you better watch out, 'cause we will be one hell of a team.
I am not going to do what I've done so many other times.
One of the reasons why I've never won an Immunity Challenge is I kill myself out fishing.
I kill myself out taking care of my tribe.
But this is more individual.
And if I'm going to beat Candice, I need every ounce of energy I got.
If Candice wants to go out and kill herself gathering wood, and making fire, and keeping it going, and boiling water, and doing everything, great!
Burn up her energy.
I'm not going to.
And I need to have in my head that I will eliminate her.
Tonight we got a third person in Redemption Island.
At least it wasn't Laura that showed up tonight.
That was my fear.
