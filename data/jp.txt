Alan is a crazy man. He just all of a sudden gets this crazy look in his eyes and I just, uh-- his drama and everything that he causes is I think maybe not worth his strength. Just, you know, a loose cannon like that kinda rocks the ship.
In the firehouse, it’s all about getting things done and taking care of business. So I’m out fishing, trying to get some food on board, and, uh, kind of just one step at a time and go from there. You know, I’ve never really been super big into drama or the confrontational type or anything like that, so, uh, you know, if I can get some fish, some lobster, things like that, and make sure everybody’s got a full belly, I think everyone should be happy and, you know, taken care of. The other night at Tribal, Ash and I got called out as the power couple. That label sucks. I don’t see ourselves as a power couple at all. We’re not dating. We’re not hooking up. We’re not doing any of that type of stuff. I mean, if we’re a power couple, I mean, might as well hooking up and being a couple. You know what I mean? Might as well take advantage of everything. So Ash and I’s, uh, connection, I think is kinda more on the backburner right now. But in the firehouse, you know, that’s kinda, you know, what, you know, what my profession is, you know, staying calm in emergency situations. I might not be the guy out there talking strategy to everybody, but I know that I need to clean my rep up a little bit and kinda straighten things out.
I don’t like to be in the limelight that much, but, uh, I mean, in this case, it’s just good for my game, because bottom line is they need me, 100%. Without me there’s no way they would be able to get through any challenge. No way.
Well, today’s Immunity Challenge, uh, didn’t go so well, but losing for us right now, is just not a big deal. Ali is next, and she has nothing she can do about it. Simple as that.
I got to eat second, but I wouldn’t mind going last, so-- just because if anything was leftover, you got to finish it off, but, uh, you just want to make sure that everybody gets their fair share and it all works out. You know, all in all, you know, by no means was I, uh, fat and happy, but it just is what it is. You take your portion and leave it for the next person. If they eat more then that’s on them, you know?
