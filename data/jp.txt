Alan is a crazy man. He just all of a sudden gets this crazy look in his eyes and I just, uh-- his drama and everything that he causes is I think maybe not worth his strength. Just, you know, a loose cannon like that kinda rocks the ship.
In the firehouse, it’s all about getting things done and taking care of business. So I’m out fishing, trying to get some food on board, and, uh, kind of just one step at a time and go from there. You know, I’ve never really been super big into drama or the confrontational type or anything like that, so, uh, you know, if I can get some fish, some lobster, things like that, and make sure everybody’s got a full belly, I think everyone should be happy and, you know, taken care of. The other night at Tribal, Ash and I got called out as the power couple. That label sucks. I don’t see ourselves as a power couple at all. We’re not dating. We’re not hooking up. We’re not doing any of that type of stuff. I mean, if we’re a power couple, I mean, might as well hooking up and being a couple. You know what I mean? Might as well take advantage of everything. So Ash and I’s, uh, connection, I think is kinda more on the backburner right now. But in the firehouse, you know, that’s kinda, you know, what, you know, what my profession is, you know, staying calm in emergency situations. I might not be the guy out there talking strategy to everybody, but I know that I need to clean my rep up a little bit and kinda straighten things out.
I don’t like to be in the limelight that much, but, uh, I mean, in this case, it’s just good for my game, because bottom line is they need me, 100%. Without me there’s no way they would be able to get through any challenge. No way.
Well, today’s Immunity Challenge, uh, didn’t go so well, but losing for us right now, is just not a big deal. Ali is next, and she has nothing she can do about it. Simple as that.
I got to eat second, but I wouldn’t mind going last, so-- just because if anything was leftover, you got to finish it off, but, uh, you just want to make sure that everybody gets their fair share and it all works out. You know, all in all, you know, by no means was I, uh, fat and happy, but it just is what it is. You take your portion and leave it for the next person. If they eat more then that’s on them, you know?


At the end of the day, we would have to vote each other off. We would probably get in a fight, because we're so competitive with everything, whether that's CrossFit or working out or something stupid in the backyard or something like that. We're just competitive 100 percent of the time, which is great. It brings out the best in us. It pushes that person to be that much better.
As much as people know that I'm coming out here, they think it's a great experience. It's a great opportunity. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity type of thing.
I wouldn't say I'm a huge Survivor fan. There are some people who are over the top with it. I just say I've been kind of watching the show as I've been growing up, and as the shows have progressed through it all. I always thought it would be very cool. I'm a super outdoorsy type of guy, and things like that. So I was like, hey! This would be a great opportunity to do that. And I finally got that opportunity to come onto the show. Here I am. Here I am talking to you. And it's exciting! Super exciting.
It's a game that has no rhyme or reason. It's ever-changing from episode to episode. As soon as you think you have things figured out, there's a twist or things don't go your way. There's no one way to play it. Every time you get with a group of people, they create their own environments. It's like the Lord of the Flies book, you know what I mean? Every group of people is so different. You can't say, OK, you played it like this this time and it worked, but when you play it this way with a different group of people with different backgrounds and experiences … I think the game's going to have to be played different. You have to buy into their backgrounds and things like that and work it, and at the end of the day, use it against them and use it to come out on top.
