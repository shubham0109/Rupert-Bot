A loose cannon like that kinda rocks the ship.
It’s all about getting things done and taking care of business.
Kind of just one step at a time and go from there.
You know, I’ve never really been super big into drama or the confrontational type or anything like that.
If I can get some fish, some lobster, things like that.
If I can make sure everybody’s got a full belly.
I think everyone should be happy and, you know, taken care of.
The other night at Tribal, Ash and I got called out as the power couple.
That label sucks.
I don’t see ourselves as a power couple at all.
We’re not dating.
We’re not hooking up.
We’re not doing any of that type of stuff.
I mean, if we’re a power couple, I mean, might as well hooking up and being a couple.
You know what I mean? Might as well take advantage of everything.
I think is kinda more on the backburner right now.
That’s kinda what what my profession is staying calm in emergency situations.
I might not be the guy out there talking strategy to everybody, but I know that I need to clean my rep up a little bit.
I need to kinda straighten things out.
I don’t like to be in the limelight that much, but in this case, it’s just good for my game, because bottom line is they need me, 100%.
Without me there’s no way they would be able to get through any challenge. No way.
Today’s Immunity Challenge didn’t go so well, but losing is just not a big deal.
There is nothing you can do about it.
If anything is leftover, you got to finish it off, but you just want to make sure that everybody gets their fair share and it all works out.
All in all by no means was I fat and happy.
You take your portion and leave it for the next person. If they eat more then that’s on them, you know?
We have to vote each other off.
We're so competitive with everything, whether that's CrossFit or working out or something stupid in the backyard or something like that.
We're just competitive 100 percent of the time, which is great.
It brings out the best in us.
It pushes that person to be that much better.
It's a great experience.
It's a great opportunity.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity type of thing.
I wouldn't say I'm a huge Survivor fan.
There are some people who are over the top with it.
I always thought it would be very cool.
I'm a super outdoorsy type of guy.
So I was like, hey! This would be a great opportunity to do that.
Here I am.
Here I am talking to you. And it's exciting! Super exciting.
It's a game that has no rhyme or reason.
It's ever-changing from episode to episode.
As soon as you think you have things figured out, there's a twist or things don't go your way.
There's no one way to play it. Every time you get with a group of people, they create their own environments.
It's like the Lord of the Flies book, you know what I mean?
Every group of people is so different.
You can't say, OK, you played it like this this time and it worked, but when you play it this way with a different group of people with different backgrounds and experiences
I think the game's going to have to be played different.
You have to buy into their backgrounds and things like that and work it.
Use it against them and use it to come out on top.
When Jeff told us that we were officially merged, it was a big relief.
It’s like, “Oh, we made it here finally”.
It was nice, it was nice to finally make that stage of the game.
So in Survivor, to make the merge is a big accomplishment.
Normally with the merge feast it’s pretty good.
This time Jeff told us it was gonna be Outback Steakhouse.
I love steak.
I didn’t know what, what to think.
This is unbelievable. Everybody’s so hungry and its amazing to be able to sit down and have a nice big piece of steak.
