I think that was a bad move on the one guy's part. I honestly can't believe he voted that way. #Survivor
This is one of the most polite and civil final fours ever. Now it's time to stab each other in the back. #SurvivorFinale #TribalCouncil
Delicious. That's a lot of meat.
David is chopping up coconut popcorn as I'm eating real popcorn.
This is a MEAN challenge. #Survivor
There are only two days I've never been able to play: days 38 and 39. Maybe one day.
Remember when Ken and David were on the outs thirty days ago?
Congratulations to my home town Kokomo for legalizing pinball this week. I remember playing them in 70's. I was a rebel.
Everyone gets so philosophical at the end of the game.

Hannah will finally be clean.
These super physical challenges right at the end really year a player apart. #survivorfinale
He leaves with honor and class. And it was hilarious. #Survivor
Hannah is just floating in there. Her name never really comes up.
When Big Tom got that bad, we made him go in the Ocean.
Hannah looks like pig pen. #survivor
How do they have rice left on day 36? They must have been given a ton. #SurvivorFinale
That's a great reward. Good looking good away from the tribe and strategy talk.
I remember when I took Amber with Jenna and I on a reward to convince her to turn on Rob. It didn't work. #Survivor #AllStars
This challenge looks like it hurts. Bloody knees and elbows on day 36 is rough. #Survivor
A reward where you're eating in front of the others is a blessing and a curse. #Survivor
Ken looks beat to hell. #survivorfinale
Does anyone else feel like there is less Christmas spirit this year? It doesn't seem like Christmas is in a few days.
Dave was able to put the paperwork he got in there. You don't give the paperwork up when you use the idol at tribal. #survivorfinale
That is a first! A fake idol to just screw with someone.
If they are sleeping on the ground there must be no bugs. #SurvivorFinale

I am still struggling with the heat at Rupert's Kids HQ! I am going to have to watch later on the DVR. See you next week!
Being a contender doesn't mean you have to make a drastic move. Sandra won twice by not doing that. #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
Those little shells that they are collecting we called eyeballs. #Survivor
So much for hours. #Survivor
If they don't stay for hours, they aren't trying. #Survivor
Laura used to think it was cool when she came on family visits and then she got to play! #Survivor
Laura just looked at me and said "great memories." It's blessed us with so many. #Survivor
You can't imagine how secluded you feel playing the game. No phone. No contact with home for 30 days. Then bam. It's emotional. #survivor
I remember wanting Big Tom to pick Laura and I to go with him. He picked @BostonRob and his brother. I was so pissed. #Survivor
It's really making me squirm watching Ken stuck. #Survivor
Ken! You have to go on your back! Not your belly! #survivor
You'd think the smaller people would move through this quicker. #Survivor
I knew I was messed up during Heroes and Villains when Laura came out and I saw her face. I was gaunt and beat up. #survivor
How does @JeffProbst not manage to weep during the family visits? #Survivor
I'm not sure if Laura or the players on @survivorcbs are crying more right now. #Survivor
I love watching this episode with Laura and remembering all the times she came to see me. #Survivor #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX #
You have to love the loved ones episode. #Survivor
It's great to be back. I missed you guys, and I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!
Get out there and vote today! If you want to make a change, vote Libertarian! #ItsOurTime
Some things to think about before you go to the polls tomorrow. If you want things to change, then you have change. https://t.co/sGafwHYk6b
The cost is too high economically. The moral cost is too high. If we want to lower crime, we have to make less criminals over a plant.
Every day I work with Rupert's Kids to change the life of young men and women that are affected by our public policy against a plant.
I spoke at a pot legalization rally. It is about more than getting high. We are destroying lives over a plant https://t.co/qrKY6lZjO2
It's sad to see them go with the merge next week.
Oh my gosh!
It's funny to see David jump when Chris moved his buff on his head. He must not like showing he's bald.
There's a learning curve. You have to let someone stay there and learn how to do it. #Survivor
Jeff can make you so crazy by yelling in the middle of the challenge. It's needed to make the show better but it distracts the players.
Another cool challenge!
I like Michaela more and more but won't last that long with that mouth. #Survivor
THAT'S a reward.
I watched Sandra win the game twice by being the person no one needed to beat. #Survivor
Keep calm Chris! #Survivor
I hope the reward is better than a cookie!
Your feelings may get hurt on #Survivor but at least you're in the game!
What was your favorite season of #Survivor? @survivorcbs
Haha! https://t.co/OrC2Sp3SBW
Thanks to @iunoprohibition for having me out to their rally today! Give them a follow! https://t.co/j6n6pIbfDJ

Awww. Poor thing. It always sucks getting voted out of @survivorcbs
Also I wanted to say GREAT JOB to @lucy4senate for her performance in the #INSen debate this past week! Can't wait to vote for you. @LPIN
Join me this Saturday in Bloomington! https://t.co/9s2wjokFQx
Wow. There will really be some tears now. #survivor
The good thing about survivor is that the person that they start talking about is not the one that goes home. #survivor
Sometimes you get lucky when you need it the most. #Survivor
A learning curve on the balance will take a while. #Survivor
Another cool challenge!
Good Ken. Let's start playing the game. Break them up. #robandamber #Survivor
Ken is fishing. üòç #Survivor
That was an early challenge! I love two challenges, even if you only win a cookie.
That's a new twist. Putting the puzzle together blindfolded. #Survivor
Nothing but a pile of sugar to make you feel better after now food for days. #Survivor
The girl has obviously never seen the game. #Survivor
Michaela got her place a little more solid with Jay. #survivor
And that's why people ask what it's like to hear that music in the jungle. #Survivor
Tears already? #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
It's a shame but Cece had to go. #survivor

I am liking Chris more and more.
Four blankets and two pillows for eight people. Enough to fight over.
Support Rupert's Kids by parking with us at the Colts game this Sunday. The lot is 733 West Street by Lucas Oil. I'll be there!
I'm having a tough time picking out a favorite. #Survivor
Where are the bites on their skin? #Survivor
You have to vote for the people you actually want to get elected! If you vote for the same people, this is what happens. @LPNational
Dear America, I'm sorry I didn't get elected Governor of Indiana in 2012 because Mike Pence won and now he's running for Vice President.
David, There's a difference between superman and stupid, man. #Survivor
The only bad part about this is that we are giving up a challenge in this episode. #Survivor
It's not a merge. It's secrets! #Survivor
Ken should show his worth and go catch food! #Survivor
Paul looks like Sammy Hagar without the money. #survivor
This game will bring out your emotions for sure. #Survivor
The shuffling of the tribes might help a few of these people. Lol #Survivor
People don't like her and it won't help her talking like that. #Survivor
I wonder if tonight might be a merge? I can't think of anything else that might be a game changer
Rex Bell did a great job tonight at the Indiana Governor's debate. On Election Day, vote for Rex &amp; Karl Tatgenhorst‚Ä¶ https://t.co/h81vX87Ea5
#RexIsRight. Road taxes should be used only for roads. #ingov
Libertarian Party beliefs on LGTB rights haven't changed since our founding. All people are deserving of equal treatment.
John Gregg had a completely different opinion four years ago on LGBT rights than he does today for political purposes. #ingov
I was the first Gubernatorial candidate to advocate for the rights of the LGBT candidate in Indiana. I'm proud to have that distinction.
How can John Gregg honestly say he's going to reform education in Indiana when he's beholden to teacher unions? #ingov
Republican Governors. Republican supermajorities in the statehouse. Wages are stagnate. Are they serious about growth? Vote Rex Bell. #ingov
#RexIsRight Less regulation, lower taxes and lower barriers to entry create more jobs and keep graduates in Indiana. #ingov

Nothing is worse than the blind side!
Survivor is a mean game. You never see it coming. #Survivor
Imagine that. The Millennials can't keep focused.
He's in the challenge? Wasn't he dying a minute ago? Gotta hand it to him.
Chopper or boat is on the way.
You're seeing why so many Survivors chop their fingers off with machetes.
Laura and I like Ken more and more.
Gosh I miss fishing there. It was so much fun. Try out just so you can fish.
Oooo they found pineapples.
FYI... There are condoms in the first aid box.
Try to hide your alliances.
You'll never be able to use a flint after banging it like that.  Lol
David was lucky his mouth didn't run him out of the game.

Please check out Rupert's Kids and see how we are changing lives. We need your financial support! https://t.co/Q7Xtgpx1Az
Laura and I are rooting for the Gen X tribe. She's a Gen Xer and I'm on the cusp of that and Baby Boomer.
I want one of those tribal masks for my wall.
Vote for @RexBell for Governor of Indiana! https://t.co/vMeO1p3tzv
Maybe they will make a Survivor with the first cast off. Haha
Going home first sucks.
She's going home soon.
He's a scared little rabbit.
When they aren't talking to you, they are talking about you.
This is an exciting #survivor because Laura has been able to stay awake past 9 PM.
Wow! The city kid made fire without a flint! #survivor
They got a night in a bed and a couple meals and then got to start over. #survivor
Wow. @survivorcbs is the most beautifully shot show in TV.
If you see @JeffProbst outside of tribal or challenges, there's a problem.
Nothing like a night of hell to get you working.

You can't believe how quickly it gets dark out there. #survivor
They've spent just hours together. How is he already so trusting and paranoid?? #SurvivorMillennialsVsGenX
Paranoia is setting in! #Survivor
They made fire already?
Love seeing a Hoosier girl in @survivorcbs! @hashtagfiggy
Jessica has 36 days to keep that advantage hidden. Good luck with that.
Ken is going to have one sweet beard soon! #Survivor
People in their twenties don't think about the future as much as fogeys do.
Jessica had a head on her shoulders! #Survivor
Take the fishing gear over chickens!
Who will win @survivorcbs ?
I love fresh meat Newbies. @survivorcbs
I can't stop smiling!
Nothing is more exciting than being on that island with @JeffProbst for the best game show on Earth: @survivorcbs

It's always sad to see someone go. It's always heartbreaking when your torch gets snuffed.
If you think there is a lot of crying on this episode, then you should see what happens off camera.
It's good to see someone out hunting food.
Banging right through this episode. #survivor
There's a lot of back stabbing in this one.
It's crazy how emotional you get out there... But I don't know about that much man love.
Let's see is Jason and Tai can bond again.
I have never seen this challenge. This is very cool. #Survivor
THAT is a tan line.
Wow. Rain in a challenge. You don't see that often.
If they didn't see the grub as food, they are getting too much food. Of course the chicken ate that solid protein.
It looks like it will be a very exciting #survivor
Time for loyalty is done. It's time to play @survivorcbs for yourself!
If you want to end the corruption of the Republicans and Democrats, you have to vote different. Vote Libertarian! @LPNational @LPIN
Today was Primary Day. If you wanted to vote Libertarian but couldn't, this is why: https://t.co/UL0v6hClG1
I'll be their guest! https://t.co/arXqDP90zZ
THAT was an exciting @survivorcbs
Their skin looks so good. There must not be too many bugs there.
Scot does not seem happy.
I wait all week and it's almost done! Two tribals make it move quick.
Jason, you need to show that you're the perfect one to take to the end because you won't get a vote.
Yikes. You don't want to show you're strong at day 29!
Take your sweet time. No one seems in a hurry!
You can taste the end at 29 days.
That fourth time just didn't seem like it counted
Man, I would love to play again.
Don't get too cocky Sydney
Those showers are so nice. You didn't ask for permission. Nothing was stopping you.
Ok. Better than a glass of water and an umbrella.
Sweet. A challenge right away. Let's see if the challenge is worth anything. "Here's an umbrella."
Sydney's face shows she isn't with Thai.
I can't be mad at Thai. If he had given up the idol he would have gone home.
That was a very good #Survivor
Arrogant and cocky will always know you out.
The game never stops. If you're not talking to someone, they are talking about you.
Nicky has been cocky through the whole show and that's hard to live with.
I love this game and show. It's so mentally challenging too. You never know what can happen. #Survivor
I love Cydney's hat!
After three weeks, you start to smell. And I haven't seen them wash off in the ocean much.
I think Jeff hated that hug.
He's a huggy little fella.
This challenge seems like it's only been ten minutes. Man up! #Survivor
I never stepped down for food even when I knew I was safe. But Jeff would make me so mad. #Survivor
When I did this, my feet barely fit. The girls look like they were on two by fours.
If they don't go for at least five hours, they are weak. #Survivor
She has to keep calm and subtle or else you go home. #Survivor
I hope Sydney can keep control of herself.
They are showing Sydney a lot. I hope she isn't going home. Post merger, go after muscle.
No one ever talks about an all boy alliance. #Survivor
There's always crying in #Survivor. Laura said she lost track of the days she cried in Survivor. She claims it was because of me.
They just held on to Scott.
Scott has the advantage in every physical challenge.
Scott needs to sit the girl on the pole and run with it. #Survivor
These reward challenges aren't really rewarding. #Survivor
The big guy can't just put her on the poll and carry her!?
One of the reasons I never won an immunity challenge is that I'd win a reward challenge and be sluggish the next day. #survivor
Cool! A challenge! #SurvivorKaohRong #Survivor #BrainsBrawnBeauty #
Laura and I like Sydney. She's our pick. #Survivor
When watching Survivor do you prefer the evil villains or the less rotten ok guys? (No one is an angel on #survivor)
I wonder who showed him what leaves to eat. It's scary to sit and pick random leaves out there. #survivor
I've seen a man bun. I don't know what that is. #Survivor
I'm a big fan of the chicken this season. #Survivor
Ugh. Just give him antibiotics!
The cleaner spot was still outside with less brush.
I haven't seen anything as bad as what I had in Pearl Islands or All Stars.
You can trust a Dr. Rupert.
I hope a challenge is coming soon.
Here are your two choices for Indiana Governor. I am supporting Rex Bell for the @lpin nomination.  https://t.co/M0uDSUuhgc
You don't spill your guts if you're trying to build an alliance! #Survivor
Michelle is a favorite of Laura and I. We haven't seen much of her. Makes me think she's made it far in the game. We hope so.
Debbie... I don't know what to say.
The best part of the merge is the food! #Survivor
So many annoying players...
A chicken isn't a pet. It's food.
It's a #Survivor curse. People get cocky on the island.
A boat AND a raft? It's like the #survivor yacht club.
Thanks to all of the people that came to raise money for Rupert's Kids this past weekend. And to our guest @ejsnyder333!
I am not running for Governor of Indiana in 2016. Please look at Rex Bell. https://t.co/8KkhndEab9. The R's and D's have let us down.
I want to be the first player to do five seasons. I feel like this last one doesn't count because I let Laura play. https://t.co/lwZP1CsbtM
I personally would like to see Peter go home because of his arrogance.
Happy birthday to my momma Georgette. She's 80 today. 80 more to go! https://t.co/9r7sO67LJu
Aww. I like all of those guys. I hate to see one of them go home. I bet they send home a beauty.
Scot is so tall he can almost run to the net.
Thanks to our friends at @StJosephBrewery for providing "refreshments" at this past weekend's fundraiser for RK. https://t.co/HnfjOd4skt
Finally a good challenge! I love the action.
Take it from someone that has gone home because of cockiness... Cut it out.  https://t.co/phhpD1CBHt
Aww she's by herself all alone with her ant friends.
I like seeing the sweeter side of @ScotPollard31 on #survivor
He could pick him up with one hand and put him in the tree.
Join us for Rupert‚Äôs Bicycle Jamboree on May 21 - https://t.co/XyAieoyBNt
Laura says she agrees there is no need for exercise in #survivor
When you're showing off with pull-ups and calling yourself the mastermind, that cockiness bites you in the behind.
You don't need exercise on #survivor. Go get firewood instead.
I've been in these tribe shuffles. They can't be rigged. They are completely random. No one knows that happens and all are surprised.
There's a lot of hugging going on. Let's see how long that hugging goes on.

Hopefully it unifies the brawn tribe.
Sometimes it is so hard to keep your mouth shut.
It's going to be a fun few hours in camp. #survivor
Brains are struggling.
The Braun tribe doesn't even care if they lose immunity at this point. #Survivor
Lol I like Cydney.
Everyone cries in @survivorcbs. I cried at least once every season. Especially my fourth trip with Laura! #Toosoon #survivor
Caleb, along with every other #survivor, wants to play again. Even if it almost kills you!
In #Survivor, you wouldn't believe how close to death you sometimes are. This is a very real game. @survivorcbs
They sewed me up and bandaged broken bones. But if they call the chopper, you are done. What an emotional #Survivor.
There are possibly a hundred(s) of people on that island for the show and now you see why they need them. #survivor
A record number of shots of the camera crew.
How many people are going to fallout?
You can see their spine and bones. Skeletons. #survivor
Is @survivorcbs the only great reality TV show? https://t.co/TuMtHdNQt6
It's hard to keep going when you know you're not going to win.  @survivorcbs
#Survivor is STILL the toughest game show out there. It darn near killed me.

You've never had a snail so good! Especially with parsley and thyme.
My friends at @bobandtom have a new mobile app. You can hear my interview with them RIGHT NOW. https://t.co/1tFGQd4QNu
Laura and I want to send our thoughts and prayers to all of those effected by today's shootings.
That was a game changing vote. #Survivor
You push yourself till you're dead out there. #Survivor
Hopefully they feed him before they vote him out?
Laura said he looked pale.
Trying to concentrate so this thing doesn't hit you in the face and Jeff doesn't stop talking.
Where are the #Survivor helmets?
Why is it that the girls always think about a girl alliance, but boys never do. #Survivor
Spencer may help the girl alliance get Joe out and before you know it, he is next. #Survivor
That's what makes you so crazy. You think you know which way the game is going and then you realize you have no idea. #Survivor
Don't we all wish we had that type of relationship with our dad.
Laura says the dad is better looking than the son. But then again, she likes the rugged type.
When Laura came out on All Stars, the bugs ate her alive. Not sure if that had been a reward or punishment for her.
Even winning is set up to make someone feel really good and someone really bad in a reward challenge.
What a mean challenge. #Survivor
Those thirty days seem like an eternity when away from your family. It's hard to describe how much you miss them. #Survivor
There is always crying on Survivor.
No matter who you are, your momma always thinks you're an angel. #Survivor

Shout out to Big Mike, who is making some big changes health wise. We love you, man.
Only one person truly gets the redemption.
And a memorable exit.
One of the most exciting and unpredictable tribal counsels ever. Wow. #Survivor
Enough with the eye rolling.
In my first game, Pearl Islands, I went to my first tribal on day 21.
No one in Survivor is more dangerous than another. It just matter who has the trust of the group at the moment.
Those three girls looked like see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
Wow. I am impressed
Laura said she hopes this is something Joe is good at.
You gotta love Keith. He's trying not to make eye contact with anyone.
Winning is exciting until you realize you've slowed yourself down for tomorrow's immunity challenge with today's reward.
Part of what makes this good television are these small things that you might not notice.
Listening to Jeff will get you freaked out. It's a long challenge and you don't need to hurry as much as you think. I got but several times.
The reward hurts you after twenty days on no sugar and no caffeine. #Survivor
You think you know who you can trust in @Survivor_Tweet, but you don't. There are so many levels. #Survivor
She knew she would get some votes. Why is she leaving mad? #Survivor
It takes a loooong time to do tribal council. You can be sitting there for an hour while people vote and then they are tallied. #Survivor
Thirteen is a big tribe. It's very difficult to navigate within that.
When Jeff talks during the challenges, it is very distracting. It's great for the viewer, but adds another layer of challenge. #Survivor
Poor Stephen. Of course he is out first. #Survivor
I love how Keith is able to stay out of all of it.
We've been waiting on chaos Cass. Maybe she's finally been released.
It becomes a completely different game when the merge happens. Every alliance is put to the test. #Survivor
There are still reservations available for Tuxes and Tennis, our big Rupert's Kids fundraiser on Nov 21. See more: https://t.co/lNddfOHrS0
Savage just realized he's out of the loop. #Survivor
Too bad. I like him. #Survivor
This episode flew by!
People spill secrets at tribal without even knowing it. #Survivor
Someone lied in Survivor??
It's never just that easy. #Survivor
Tasha is tough. #Survivor
They'd eat it if they were more hungry. #Survivor
You have no idea how bad that smells. #Survivor
I bet that smells nice. Tastes like bacon. #Survivor
It's all protein. As long as you can keep it down you don't mind. This is making me hungry. #Survivor
Stephen is going to try too hard and end up having the tribe turn against him. #survivor
Strength is not Stephen's strong suit. That kind of talk scares him. #Survivor
You're really going to argue with Jeff Foxworthy on cooking in the woods? #Survivor
What a great shot of Savage in his testimonial. @Survivor_Tweet is the most beautifully shot show on TV.
I meant as in it isn't functional. My wife is sitting next to me. I'm not risking life and limb. Lol https://t.co/jLe5QJ0CxB
NEVER get too cocky in #Survivor
It's fried chicken. But it's jungle fried chicken. But it's a mental defeat if you're not eating it. #Survivor
Nothing like a string bikini in a challenge. #Survivor
LOL This is a fun challenge. #Survivor
I'll bet Chaos Cass will be nice this time. #Survivor
Always try to lose your buff as soon as they give you the new one so you can keep the old one. :)
Survivor makes you appreciate your family more. I was so glad to be able to take Laura. It made us a stronger couple.
"Family emergency" gives you chills. #survivor
A challenge in the first seven minutes of the game? I love it. #Survivor
This would have happened months ago so I hope everything is ok. #Survivor
Real life takes priority when you are faced with it in the game. There was zero question about what to do. #Survivor
It's never good when Jeff shows up to camp. That's a terrible way to leave, worrying the whole way home. #PrayersforDanny #Survivor
Take it from someone that has been voted out of #Survivor many times... It sucks.
#Survivor really needs to be on two hours a week.
That was a really exciting #Survivor
That is an outrageous #Blindside on #survivor. She's going to be so mad at loser camp.
Memories are short in #survivor
Where the hell did they find that watermelon?? #Survivor
She should go home for saying there is nothing wrong with going to tribal council. #Survivor
Joe definitely takes care of that tribe. #Survivor
Nothing like helping the other guy.
Laura just said she can't believe she played this silly game. She says it's surreal to watch it after playing it. #Survivor
Slingshots are always fun. I LOVE a two challenge episode! #Survivor
The hardest thing when fishing was doing it alone. Take off fish the spear, and sticking it on a vine tied to your waist. #Survivor
They all act as if they are alone for the first time.
No champagne with the OJ?
Enough comfort for one or two of you. #Survivor
We need a challenge. #Survivor
FairPlay and I had the same discussion when we played. They never stop writing your name down. #Survivor
Happy birthday to Abi!
I love Wednesdays! It's #Survivor time! Best night of the week.
It's nice to see someone that appreciates the experience. #Survivor
Savage grinned because they aren't focused on him. Sandra won on the "anyone but me" mantra. #Survivor
"I miss Abi" is the biggest lie on #Survivor since "My grandma died." #Survivor
I get it. I'm still mad at @JonnyFairplay for writing my name down twice. I can't wait to get him back. #Survivor
Wooooooow #SURVIVOR
This is a fun challenge to watch! #Survivor
Does Ciera sit out every other challenge? #Survivor
Did Joe shave his arm pits? #Survivor
Savage needs to do some serious bonding with his tribe, though. #survivor
When you have something like that in your camp, it is heaven. #Survivor
Should've played Joe! #survivor
Ok. You've got it. Now RUN! #Survivor
You can watch every episode of #survivor! https://t.co/6oRnhlP3cr
Joe... You chicken! #Survivor
I used the grill every day in Pearl Islands. #Survivor
It's like snipe hunting on #Survivor
Abi is Russell in female form. #Survivor
Be sure to join us for Tuxes and Tennies benefiting Rupert's Kids! https://t.co/w51XMkyaX0 #Survivor
Jeez. There is a lot of crying tonight. #Survivor
Wow. Woo stood up. #Survivor
Wow. Abi should just shut her mouth. #Survivor
Everyone is lining up behind him. That's amazing. #Survivor
This challenge is made to hurt you! #survior
You just said someone is a train wreck. So you align with the train wreck? #Survivor makes you do dumb things.
You are SO CLOSE to others in every way during #Survivor that it makes you crazy.
While we are in commercial, please check out what we are doing at Rupert's Kids, my charity. #Survivor
I hope we come back to a kick ass challenge. #Survivor
I played with Andrew on Pearl Islands and he is a great guy. #survior
Keep it together savage! #survivor
Holy cow. They have a lot of food. #Survivor
Where did they get the netting from already? #Survivor
I hope the tribe is smart enough to keep Joe until the merge. #Survivor
Jeff is already playing both sides of the game. I wonder how long before he gets caught. #SurvivorCambodia #SurvivorSecondChance #Survivor
I am so excited for the new season of #survivor. It is still the best reality show on tv. And so glad to be tweeting with you. #Survivor
We are out at @IndyPopCon this weekend in booth 539 talking Rupert's Kids, taking pics and signing autographs! http://t.co/UUcG5NQQnX

I love the views on #Survivor. They pick such beautiful locations.
I just cast my vote for Laura Boneham! #Survivor #TeamTieDye
"It isn't me going home" are the famous last words at Tribal Council. #Survivor
Does that mean Rodney is going home? #Survivor
People forget that was her promise for the tribe. #Surivivor
I can't believe Dan isn't pushing mama C for the white collar idol. #Survivor
Wait? Is that a drinking fountain?? #Survivor
Has this challenge even gone on for 5 minutes? #Survivor
It looks like something grabbed him! #Survivor
Worst day of his life and he is PLAYING #SURVIVOR!? #PityParty
Man this season is moving fast. #Survivor
It is easy to feel in charge with an idol in your pocket. #Survivor
Tyler has faith in Rodney? He is a good actor! #survivor
Foreshadowing: Beat the hornet's nest. #Survivor
Is psychotic one of the 3 Cs?
Then you get to play #Survivor!
How many would LOVE to spend their birthday playing #Survivor!? Love what you got!
What is worse than being picked last? Not being picked at all! #Survivor
What a nice reward! #Survivor
We are going to have an immunity and a reward challenge. #Survivor
Someone is bound to have their feelings hurt when there is a tribal council. #survivor
That was a pretty darn good episode of #Survivor.
Ohhh. I think they mind. Just wait till they get back to camp. #Survivor
Very rarely do you see clapping at a tribal council. #Surivivor
Things like this makes everyone in the jury smile a lot. They love the squirming and the drama. #Survivor
Hi Joe. We miss you. #Survivor
I think Dan just told Mike how to use his idol... #Survivor
The episode goes fast and there is more excitement with two challenges. #Survivor
If Mike gave his hidden idol to Shirin, then they could change the entire game. #Survivor
I hope this lasts for hours! #Survivor
Two immunities... See? #Survivor can be nice sometimes.
Sweet! Another challenge!
It is good to see them get back to a really cool reward. That is so fun to watch. #Survivor
You go home when you're too comfortable. #Survivor
Remember your three C's Rodney. Calm, Cool and Collected.
I really don't have a favorite player. I can't tell you who I am rooting for. It is like, "Who do you hate the least?" #Survivor
Loved that Challenge. #Survivor
At least the tribe of eaters will appreciate the award more.
Yikes... Did Dan break a collar bone?
How big of a flip can he do?? #Survivor
I don't feel sorry for either of them. Move on.
It's beautiful when people come together. http://t.co/apEDf1ydIJ - Volunteers Step Up After School Closings Leave Baltimore Kids Hungry
Things are going great for Rupert's Kids. Love our donors! http://t.co/AmeJy3odpK
Jumping for joy. That is the happiest torch snuff I have seen in a long time. #Survivor
That was a very exciting #tribalcouncil
They aren't starving if they aren't eating the head. The cheeks are the sweetest part of that fish. #Survivor
Who else thinks Will is going to go insane at tribal? #Survivor
Mike is growing on Laura and I. #Survivor
With Joe gone, we will now see who emerges as the #Survivor tough guy.
It is just so exciting. #Survivor gets in your blood.
What a mean game. Why would I want to play this again? #IDo #Survivor
Sometimes you lose your mind in #Survivor. #WHOVOTEDFORME
Now you are just being mean... Coming from the guy that didn't get a letter from home. #Survivor
BTW, you don't have to wait until someone is stuck on an island to write a loved one a letter, and it will mean just as much. #Survivor
It is only an advantage if you can use it as an advantage. A double vote isn't that great of advantage. #SayAdvantageAgain #survivor
Wow... So much love on #Survivor right now.
Letters from home are absolute gold. #survivor
Nothing makes you more relaxed than a large man yelling "YOU BETTER RELAX" in your direction.
That is a good man! Most #Survivor players would not have done what he just did.
I would say that the one who needed the advantage won it, but they all need the advantage.
Oh the #Survivor drama. This game makes you insane.
Be sure to check out http://t.co/SgRfB7DEp8 right now! We have so many exciting events and programs taking place soon. #Survivor
It is amazing what you can convince people to believe. #FakeIdol
I have to say that I am pretty disappointed with the result of that tribal council. What a bummer. #Survivor
LOL
WWWWWWWOOOOOW! #Survivor
She is looking so longingly at a shower and a hot meal... #Survivor
This game makes you crazy!! #Survivor
It is so odd to see someone fight so hard in challenges because she wants to leave. #Survivor
An increase in music intensity always someone is dropping out.
If this challenge doesn't go an hour, I will be disappointed.
How to start a fight on #Survivor: Kill 50% of the chickens while half of the tribe is not there.
How many bribes can you sneak back for tribe-mates? #Survivor
She just articulated why most Survivors want to go back!
You can hear the skin screeching on the slide. Oof. #Survivor
I say this before he falls... This is Will's best challenge yet. I have gained a lot of respect for him. #Survivor
LOL
OUCH. #Survivor
I love an intricate and long challenge. You can mess up and still win the challenge. #Survivor
When someone wants to go home, you let them. Otherwise, they whine and cry all day long. And you get three more days! #survivor
Ugh. That is the worst walk of shame you'll ever take. #survivor
That is a giant tribe. #Survivor
He's athletic. He's smart. He is quick. Joe is a triple threat. #survivor
I love this time period in #survivor. At day 22, you're just getting into it.
Now who won the reward challenge? #survivor
It is always interesting to see someone tell everyone how to play the game, but they aren't doing much in the game. #Survivor
98% of the time someone says they "are just trying to be nice" they are actually just being a jerk. #Survivor
What is worse than everyone know you have an #ImmunityIdol? Everyone knowing you have an immunity idol and not having an immunity idol.
It is nice to see a player in the game... Someone that acts and thinks strategically, but doesn't act like a jerk. #survivor
Unless that soda contains an immunity idol. #survivor
Your body does not take the soda and beer well. #survivor
THAT is why I like separating reward and immunity challenges. The action is doubled and more exciting! #survivor
I think Joe is the one to beat in this game. He has the potential to run the board on challenges. #Survivor
Poor Rodney. Jeff is ALWAYS the final word, though. #Survivor
I've won island pizza as a reward. It isn't the pizza you are used to. "Reward" is a strong word. Papa Johns doesn't deliver there #Survivor
Ooo, an early challenge! Maybe we get two this episode. #Survivor
I cannot believe how much food they still have after the merge! They still have a large spread. #Survivor
Nothing is sadder than leaving with an idol in your pocket... And no, you can't take them as souvenirs. #Survivor
As if this challenge wasn't tough enough... This cannot last much longer with the rain. #Survivor
This is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical challenge. Can you control your mind? Can you focus on something other than pain?
Wow. This is a tough one. Who has the upper hand? #Survivor
Excellent! A challenge!
I am not sure if you see the commercials I see, but "Mediterranean Tacos" made me laugh. #Arbys
She was a little too eager to pee on his leg. #Survivor
It's really too bad we as Hoosiers have to suffer for our government's faults. #RFRA #IndyWelcomesAll
Don't be an idiot in camp tonight either. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Instead of looking confused, be happy it wasn't you. #blindside #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Looks like more than one person felt that #blindside
Gosh! I miss playing the game #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
#worstsurvivormoveever
Could this #immunitychallenge be anymore painful to watch? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
You NEVER throw an #immunitychallenge #survivor101 #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
At least SOMEONE is out there fishing! #pelican #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
One of the best things about a #survivor reward is seeing something that hardly anyone else gets too #SurvivorWorldsApart #seaturtles
It's amazing how a reward can make things OK... For a little bit, anyway. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Guess that win came with a little #girlpower (and Will was there too) #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Imagine that... Will pulling the rear AGAIN #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
YES! Another early #RewardChallenge in this episode #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Hoping my friends in Oklahoma stay safe with all the tornado activity taking place tonight!
Are you getting ready for tonight's episode of #survivor ?#SurvivorWorldsApart Only about 10 minutes to get in front of a TV &amp; tweet w/ me
That was a classy exit. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That was a mouth-dropping #blindside #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
When there's not much difference in physicality, it's all about #camplife #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Any time you're that confident, you're done. Trust me. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
No matter how much planning you do before #tribalcouncil , it can all change in an instant. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
In a physical challenge, it's clear who's going to tribal with these new tribes. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's not what an apology looks like. #Survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It really sucks when @JeffProbst tells you, "Got nothing for ya!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's one heckuva #reward ! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
YES! Another #RewardChallenge ! LOVE THAT! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Didn't think #tribalcouncil was going THAT way. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's so bittersweet for a #survivor fan to be at your first #tribalcouncil. UR lighting ur torch, but UR at tribal. #SurvivorWorldsApart
Is cocky one of the #3Cs ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
And now the game begins for the Blue Collar tribe. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The tide has REALLY turned for the Blue and No Collar tribes. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I want to root for Will, but he's gotta give me something to root for! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
This #immunitychallenge looks cool and SAFE. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I guess it pays not to eat meat. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
There's always one that wants to have a chicken for a pet. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's the first taste of defeat for the blue collars. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's amazing how many people play the game with major injuries. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That HAD TO HURT! #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I love it when they start with a reward challenge. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I still can't believe the blue collars haven't caught a single fish. What are they waiting for? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That snake's going to make a nice meal. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I'm ready for 2 hours of #survivor. Are you?
I've been eBay-ing wrong. I could've been donating to Rupert's Kids this whole time! http://t.co/JcH5zNUjQA
Oooooh! Two hours next week... Will you join me? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
When @JeffProbst puts out your fire, that's a long, hard walk when you leave. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Anyone who didn't see that coming at tonight's #tribalcouncil ? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The game is getting too easy. Wells, lots of food, immunity idols.... Geez! What is there to survive? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Clothes in the barrel and more body parts covering holes will get more water in the bucket #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
That's just enough comfort to start a fight #BringOnTheDrama #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
FINALLY! It's time for the #ImmunityChallenge #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I don't know if I've mentioned it lately, but I would LOVE to be the 1st player to play the game FIVE TIMES. (hint, hint) @Survivor_Tweet
.@JadaHoyer I would LOVE to go back for a FIFTH time. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
What part of the #3Cs is throwing firewood? #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
.@PhilNull There's no telling. Once the game is played, there's no going back. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The game really changed when the focus became searching for immunity idols. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Laura says that lizards make better pets than food. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
I can't believe none of the Blue Collars are going fishing!!!
#survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
Have you "liked" my new Facebook page? http://t.co/DxjXrOR3wL 
Don't worry, we still have the Rupert's Kids page too: http://t.co/9MfeUeTVzc
Paranoia already? This is going to hurt your game... It's only Day 7. #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
The answer (in front of your tribe) is always, "Yes, I trust you!" #survivor #SurvivorWorldsApart
It's almost time for #SurvivorWorldsApart . Will you be watching w/ me? #Survivor
Oh Feathers.
She can hear something. She just laughed at what Will said and wasn't looking at him. #survivor
The first time you are at tribal, and you dip your torch, it is one of the most exciting moments in life. #Survivor
When you are cocky enough to think you are controlling the entire game, that is when it bites you!
You don't vote your strength out. That is pure male ego. #survivor
With 6 on a tribe, you need 4 to come together and that is tough! #Survivor
You can tell by the music when the game is over.
Jeff needs a lozenge!
OK. I just got the look. Of course I would prefer if Laura was there... #survivor #Doghouse
Man, challenges make me miss the game. I still want to play the game. Especially after that last exit. With or without Laura. #survivor
What kind of spear is that? A sharp stick? #survivor
I hope they come back with a challenge. They are my favorite part of the game. #Survivor
You'd think he'd be good with coconuts.
Vince's paranoia will alienate and destroy him! #Survivor
Mike is taking on the worker role, and complaining about it. You can't whine about it! Shut up and do it! #survivor
She is amazingly good at reading lips! #survivor
#survivor brings out so many emotions!
She isn't shy... That is for sure. #survivor
But she is still wearing her bra! #survivor
It can alienate him unless he can convince others to go naked. #SurvivorWorldsApart
And there they go... #survivor
It is good to see Max still has his clothes on! #Survivor
Poster for a new movie I'm shooting later this year. What do you think? http://t.co/HCBjC0xgmw
Thanks for the postcards @DavidHTroyer. Stay safe and thank you for all you do!
It SUCKS being the first one voted off! ;P
I do not have an early #Survivor. I think I am rooting for the #BlueCollar tribe with a slight edge over the #NoCollar tribe.
Wow. I am shocked. #Survivor
I knew she couldn't keep it a secret! #Survivor
Foreshadowing...
I LOVE to see #SurvivorWorldsApart trending. It proves @Survivor_Tweet is still the best show on TV. Kudos @JeffProbst @MarkBurnettTV
Now let's see if Carolyn can keep her mouth shut about that. It is SO difficult to not share the news. #Survivor
Thanks! @kennaboz23 RT @RupertBoneham is the best live tweeter, and is one of the reasons I still watch #Survivor.
"Do you like-like him?!" Please check yes or no on this coconut." #Survivor
By the way, if you go on #Survivor, please pack boxers.
Apparently this woman is just coco-nuts for everyone. #Survivor
Apparently this woman is just coco-nuts for everyone. #Survivor
Always comforting when a large man in his underpants has one leg up on the log next you and says, "You've got a friend in me." #Survivor
At this point, you are starting to get hungry. You are sweaty and nasty. Politness is wearing off. Frustration is setting in. #Survivor
She is falling out of her top left and right. Of course he is in love. #Coconuts #Survivor
Already a romance brewing? They are coco-nuts for each other. #Survivor
Weakness? No. Those are fluids leaving the body. #Survivor
Seriously... EVERYONE knows you've got to cook your scorpions. #SurvivorWorldsApart
Already calling him the devil... Evil Russell may have some competition. #Survivor #WorldsApart
I don't like to follow rules, so I'd probably fit in "No Tribe." #Survivor - What tribe would you be on?
Not sure what tribe I'd be on. I run a couple businesses. I do a lot of construction. But there IS the tie dye thing. #Survivor
Every season of @Survivor_Tweet MUST have at least one #BigBeard. #Survivor

This has got to be the most gentle #FinalTribalCouncil I've ever seen! #survivorfinale
Natalie is going to be HARD. TO. BEAT. #survivorfinale #Final3
If Jaclyn wins the #finalimmunity, it's an amazing comeback #survivorfinale
This #finalimmunity challenge is a tough one, but these guys don't seem to have a sense of urgency #survivorfinale It's Day 38!
#OldGuyClub RT @cclouse05: @RupertBoneham is still my favorite Survivor candidate all time but Kieth is right up there!
That was a heckuva #blindside and earned Natalie some votes from the jury. Biggest move? #survivorfinale
WOW! #survivorfinale
Anyone who helps Lexi open her presents early and @replies me proof of donation will get a special gift from me! http://t.co/Vt0uofns7w
That win in the #immunityChallenge for Keith could mean that he could win this whole thing #survivorfinale
AGREED! RT @posty_83: @RupertBoneham I would LOVE to see you on there again! You were out too soon last time! #survivorfinale
Keith has GOT TO be feeling good about this #immunityChallenge #survivorfinale
Us old guys can cheer each other on! RT @PredatorLittle: @RupertBoneham kieth needs to win #survivorfinale #oldguysclub
You know... If @JeffProbst called me RIGHT NOW, I could be ready to play tomorrow. ;-) #survivorfinale
That practice is really going to help Keith in the #immunitychallenge #survivorfinale
Our friend Lexi lost presents that were miraculously found. Will you help her open them early? #survivorfinale http://t.co/Vt0uofns7w
That's quite a #reward for Keith. Lots of power in sending someone to #exileisland AND getting the advantage #survivorfinale
. @JeffProbst loves that line. "That will leave a mark." :-) #survivorfinale
When they tell you to take as much rope as you think you'll need, you will probably need it all. #survivorfinale
I sure do miss sitting backstage, watching the #survivorfinale on the monitors and waiting to see who walks away with that big check.
There are always lots of tears on #survivor, but there are even more on #bloodvswater #survivorfinale

I love to bowl! My friends at Pinheads in Indy are donating $5 to Rupert's Kids from gift certificate sales. http://t.co/pfJKj1BpDw
There are some people that are happy in that council. And some that are ready to die! #Survivor
Even with all that she's not that likable. #Survivor
It is so easy to lose track of the game when you are in the game. #Survivor
God's finger knocked that off. #Survivor
You can tell them no! I set my own bones in the game. Stay! #Survivor
That looks like a torture device.  #Survivor
Help Lexi pay it forward. Please retweet this story! http://t.co/UcYYI9QC2G #survivor
Laura and I were dreaming of that final couple spot and alone in camp! #sigh #Survivor #BloodvsWater
If they are smart, they can outline their six day strategy and stick together to the end. #Survivor
What are you doing?! #Survivor
Help Lexi pay it forward: http://t.co/UcYYI9QC2G #teamtiedye #christmas #Survivor Every dime keeps a kid off the streets and working!

WOW! That's gonna shake some things up! #Survivor
You're so hungry that ANYTHING looks good to eat. #RatatTribalCouncil #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
You know, I'd love to play the game again, with or WITHOUT Laura ;-) #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
I can't help but like my fellow #oldman Keith. #Survivor
I was so HAPPY to be at Day 32 &amp; later, there were no tears. It was GREAT to be that close... #Survivor
Playing with a #lovedone can also give you a different perspective on things. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The way she's playing, Natalie could win this whole game. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Every decision you make gets more important as you get near the end. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur Did Natalie make the right one?
Do they get to keep the bed at camp after the reward? #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Tough challenge, but a heckuva reward! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
WOW! Everyone? #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The #silenttreatment might be their undoing. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
A good #boyfriend is always quick to apologize #jonandjaclyn #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Jon &amp; Jaclyn is a reverse @BostonRob &amp; Amber pair. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Think Jaclyn will make Jon clean up in the ocean? When you're out there, you don't realize how dirty you are. #survivorsanjuandelsur
Alec &amp; Reed need to start scrambling! #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
This #immunitychallenge looks TOUGH! #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Jon &amp; Jaclyn have been in the middle of the whole game. Until they are broken up, they will be in the middle #survivorsanjuandelsur
Not a bad bit of work #immunityidol #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Gotta have that #immunityidol once you play yours! You're a target, Jon. #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
.@JeffProbst didn't mention the best part. A SHOWER and an indoor bathroom! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Missy is showing that the game is taking its toll on her. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Lots of revenge and anger comes out in #challenges like this one. #survivorsanjuandelsur
The overnight #RewardChallenge is awesome to play for #survivorsanjuandelsur
These challenges ALWAYS show the alliances for what they are. #survivorsanjuandelsur
As good as it is to play #survivor with a loved one, I wonder how bad it is to play with a loved one.. #survivorsanjuandelsur
It's #Survivor time! #survivorsanjuandelsur
Oh my gosh! With all the holiday craziness and family in town, I'm going to miss watching #survivor with you tonight.

Laura agrees. She just said #TribalCouncil is incredibly stressful. #Survivor
Ugh. As if tribal isn't bad enough, it's raining. #Survivor
When you talk too much at tribal, you become someone that isn't trusted. #Survivor
Will Jon side his wife or his game? Trust me, it's a long-term/short-term happiness decision! #Survivor
Keith is doing what Laura was sent home for... Telling someone they are going home. They have a day to turn it on him. #Survivor
The application to play #Survivor is now online. I am filling out mine! Are you filling out yours?
The entire game is changed every time the immunity necklace is placed around someone's neck. #Survivor
Mental challenges are so difficult when you're mind is fading because of the sun, lack of sleep, stress, and lack of food and water.
Jacquelyn is pretty confident in her ability to control Jon. #SurvivorCBS #Survivor

I've been on reward challenges where someone ate until they puked &amp; then came back and kept eating. Any guesses who? #TacoOverload #Survivor
Your mind says "Eat it all!" But once it hits your deteriorating body, it rebels. It's not pretty. #survivor @Survivor_Tweet
All they do is kiss in camp and he just blew her a kiss? #Survivor
There is a lot of muscle on that team. #Survivor
Just what your body needs when it's been starving and dehydrating for three weeks: alcohol. #Survivor #SurvivorTURNEDUP
Sweet challenge! @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
Right to a challenge! I love it. #Survivor
The posturing in #survivor is almost primal. #beatschest
They are fine until they break down as a couple! #Survivor #survivorwednesdays #survivorsanjuandelsur #BloodvsWater
I cannot believe how quickly #Survivor rolled around! These weeks are flying by.
November 22nd is coming soon. Have you gotten your Tuxes &amp; Tennies tix yet?
http://t.co/CbgAfU4QgF
I've never seen Jeff do a private tribal council. #Survivor
In #Survivor it's sometimes best to just ignore things. Leave it alone.
Congrats to Jeff Foxworthy for winning the first individual immunity. #Survivor #Keith
That is a giant tribe.
If EVERYONE gathered, not just her, they'd be in better shape. #Survivor
#TrailMixScandal is what? 10 nuts?
#TrailMixScandal
It is such a huge advantage to have your mom with you in the game. #Survivor
I was happy to have Laura with me in loser camp, but it would have been so fun to see her in a merge. #Survivor
Where the hell did these guys get winter coats?! #Survivor
That's a sin to use a Hawaiian sling for a crab. Catch some fish! #Survivor
Whenever things fall into place that easily, beware. #Survivor
It won't be blood vs water. It's going to be couples vs. singles. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Unless you have someone ready to give away an immunity idol to a villain then the merge wasn't so exciting. #Survivor
Anything can happen and your game can get better again. #Survivor
As a player, the merge is such an exciting time. If you're down, it's a time to regroup and swing other down players to your side. #survival
Everyone is talking about a merge but it may not be what's planned... #Survivor
Keith is primed for an attack of paranoia.
Who's excited about #survivorsanjuandelsur tonight? Will you be tweeting along at 8?
Thanks for the fantastic welcome, Shelbyville! http://t.co/hsZzdyTj9U Check out our pics here: https://t.co/nYSNOsOzY9

For the first time in YEARS, I took a sick day, hoping to tonight's #iama. I'm sorry to cancel at the last minute, but we will do it soon.
A night of soaking, wet, cold rain. No food. Hours of sitting around. And the hunger. And then intense physical activity. #Survivor
While you're in your house, it's easy to judge her rain reaction. But the rain beats you down physically and mentally. #survivor
"I need this person to go before I go." - Yes, I think that's the point of the game.
It is so easy to judge game play AFTER consequences are known. You have so much time for hindsight. It makes you crazy. #Survivor
Hoosiers, join me for a VERY fun event Saturday: We are smashing and launching pumpkins at Waterman's Farm (Indy) https://t.co/htX057LMTX
NOTHING is better than a #RewardChallenge with real food. I love meat on a stick! Your body is craving nutrients at this point in the game.
Tomorow night Laura &amp; I will do a @reddit Ask Me Anything #Survivor #teamtiedye #IAmAonReddit #survivorsanjuandelsur http://t.co/nQJplHwbsb
Very clever, sneaky game play. #Survivor
Looking forward to next week's Reddit #IAmA . We'll be using the u/TeamTieDye user name, since it will be both Laura and I.
I don't believe it! Dad's gonna be hard to live with tonight. You thought he was bad about the rice... #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
No matter what, Keith better not go out with a "souvenir." He needs to play that idol. #Survivor #tribalcouncil
It's ALWAYS "scramble city" leading up to #tribalcouncil #Survivor
I guess #hunaphu needs to get better at hunting and fishing quick. #Survivor
WOW! They just cannot be stopped, no matter who is on their tribe. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
I've gotten a little muddy playing the game... #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur http://t.co/WmP82nMRpH
At the end of the 2nd week, you FINALLY start feeling "OK" in the game. #Survivor
I remember them fighting over the TINY scrap of meat that attaches to a clam's shell. #Survivor
Oh, Dale... The one less mouth might just be you! #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Dale's lucky to have his daughter there, but he's probably not going to listen. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Food is always something that tribes will fight over. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Next Thursday @ 7:30 PM EDT, Laura and I will be doing an #IAmA on Reddit. Will you join us? http://t.co/9dI3zepNLz
I wish Laura and I would have made it to the point of playing together in #BloodVsWater #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Even though it seems like a set up, every time I've dug my hand around and around. It ALWAYS works out for me. #survivorsanjuandelsur
Drop your buffs? Anyone think this was happening tonight? #survivorsanjuandelsur
Thanks to all the folks who showed up tonight to watch #Survivor w/ us at @TeddysBgrJoint ! Great times w/ a great crowd.
Looking forward to visiting @IndyStyle in the morning to talk about Rupert's Kids' TENTH Annual Tuxes &amp; Tennies. Will you be watching?

It's amazing how often that seems to happen on #Survivor #karma
Everyone forgot about Keith again. It's amazing how that happens. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR #Survivor
Drew is talking himself right out of this game. #Survivor
The first time you have these talks before your first #tribalcouncil, you get SOOOOO paranoid. #survivor #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Everything changed for the Drake Tribe when we threw the challenge. It was the start of a slide. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
The #kingpin might get a #blindside with that cocky attitude. #Survivor #tribalcouncil #survivorsanjuandelsur
I used to dream of swimming challenges. #Immunitychallenge #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
It's amazing how all these twists and turns can turn your game around #immunityidol #survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
Drew is CRAZY to think that throwing the challenge will work out well. It NEVER does. #Survivor #survivorsanjuandelsur
That is one heckuva reward. #survivor Comfort is nice, but it always causes drama at camp. #bloodvswater
They should've never traded the flint in the first place! #Survivor
If you're in Central Indiana, we'll be having a #survivor watch party next Wednesday. If you can, join us: https://t.co/jTWogouzah
Drew certainly has a different perception of his game. Your true colors always show. #Survivor
They're gonna be so sorry they got rid of John when they have a physical challenge... #Survivor
Any predictions for tonight's #survivorsanjuandelsur ?

It's always nice to have souvenirs. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Watching tonight REALLY makes me want to play #Survivor again.
Did not see that!! WOW! I think it's gonna hurt them. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR #blindside
.@JeffProbst is right... #TribalCouncil is always a little CRAZY #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It might be a little early to take out "the biggest threat" #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It is such a morale killer for a tribe that keeps losing. #immunitychallenge #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
John's playing a great physical game. It will be his reputation and his social game that hold him back. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
They aren't very covert with their scheming, are they? #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
You'd be surprised how good those snails taste when you're that hungry. I've eaten many of those snails... #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
What did Julie THINK was going to happen when she left to play this game w/ John? #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
That was a missed opportunity by Wes to go to #ExileIsland himself #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Pulling for dad! At our age, we know the eyes and the balance are quick to go. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
TWO REWARDS!! #Survivor
It never ends well for someone who sleeps when everyone else is working. Everyone thinks you're lazy. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
It's amazing how the guys bond together... For some reason, the girls find it hard to work w/ each other. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR
Josh has the potential to be very strong in his tribe... Let's see how well he does tonight. #SURVIVORSANJUANDELSUR

There is always crazy talk at tribal counsel. It drives you crazy! #Survivor
Alright, that was fun to watch. #ClashOfTheOldGuys #Survivor
I loved this challenge when I battled Coach. It helped me release a little hostility towards him at the time. #Survivor
This challenges beats the heck out of you. #Survivor
Maybe there is an idol buried close to their camp and it isn't the thing tied to the well... Hmmm... Thoughts? #Survivor
I'd tell them that I'd build a roof over the fire. Don't give up the fishing gear! #Survivor
If you love him, you'll go to exile island! #Survivor #Cmon!
These challenges in the arena look big, but that is a tight area and it favors smaller people. #survivor

‚Äú@RickSwansonNY: @RupertBoneham Same here Rupert. Or the tribe names, lol‚Äù I just said the same thing!
Despite the "pets," Laura just said she'd play in a heartbeat. It gets in your blood. The game. Not the parasites. #Survivor
You can't truly understand how hard being voted out as number 1 can be until it happens to you.
Where did the Baylor vote come from? Who is that out of the loop?
How does Jeff learn their name so quickly? I can't name one person after this episode. #Survivor
Welcome to the sad tribe. #Survivor
Maybe there are pumas on the island... But there are definitely a few cougars. #Survivor
#Survivor is hard, and the toll of the game can last long after you return home. @Survivor_Tweet
It's been over a year since we played #BloodvsWater, and Laura is finally getting rid of the pets she brought home. #parasites
Laura just said that I talk too much during #Survivor now. I used to not let anyone talk. But it's ok. I'll watch it again tonight.
One of the smallest things in #Survivor that can kill you are the smallest things: the bugs. And we aren't seeing a lot of bugs.
When using the lens, focus on your finger till it burns. Helps find the focal point. #Survivor #SurvivalTip

At this point in the game, the pain is so real. You can't see the level of misery on TV. #Survivor
Tony has to play an idol before the last four. You can't use it to get to the final three. #Survivor
I am sure Tony is actually a really good guy in person, but he is "#Survivor Crazy." It makes you do things you wouldn't normally.
Tony could sit calmly and quietly and end up in the final three. I do not understand why he is talking. #Survivor
I will be on @HSN on the 14th of this month showing off @iLoveToCreate Tulip One-Step Tie-Dye Kit at 1 AM and 4 PM EST, so set your DVR!
My final 4 predictions - Spencer, Tony, Tasha, and Kass (because she is sneaky and Wu is nice.) #Survivor
Good for you, man. The brains tribe is still kicking butt. #Survivor
I think Tasha HAS to get this one, and is probably the only one that can. #Survivor
Why is Tony worried when he has a special idol? When he votes someone, they are heading home. #Survivor
I still believe that is Tasha makes it to the end, she will win. #Survivor
EVERY TIME three people are alone in this game, those three will be the final three. #Survivor

If Spencer and Tasha can stick together, they can be in the final two. #Survivor
Tony is GREAT at stirring the pot. He has turned out to be a great player. #Survivor
Maybe Spencer has a magic idol?
Good for her! #Survivor
This is a great equalizing game for this crowd. Not balance/strength/etc... #Survivor
If he wins immunity... I WILL go insane. #Survivor
Can he wave that in Spencer's face any more? #Survivor
How many advantages can Tony get? #Survivor
I've been team Tasha from the beginning, but I have to side with Spencer here.
Someone say $500!
Protein is what your body truly needs when you are on the island. That moment is as good as any earthly pleasure. #Survivor
That rice is more nutritious than the ridiculous candy. #survivor
NO nutritional value at all. #Survivor
I cannot believe some of the silly things they waste the money on. #Survivor
Some already have their letter, so they can buy food. But if I didn't have the letter, I'd save it.
I LOVE auction day! It is always one of the more exciting episodes. #Survivor
How lucky can you get? #Survivor
Fleeing to the #SpyShack #Survivor
Man, it has to be tough to balance your balls that high. #Survivor #Sorry
Jeff is great at telling people where to put their balls. #Survivor
There is no way I could do that. #Survivor
Everyone on this season of #Survivor is so likable. I wouldn't even qualify Tony as a villain.
Big emotions and full bellies. That was a great reward. #Survivor
A good episode of @Survivor_Tweet has some crying. #Survivor
That is a GREAT surprise. The others will be so crushed. #Survivor
Man does that look good! And I have eaten today... #Survivor
"Did you break your butt?" LOL
How great is it that Tony gets to sit alone with the people betrayed, while Spencer and Tasha have some alone time. #Survivor
See? #Survivor
He is tough enough to pull himself in the boat. The puzzle is the equalizer here. #Survivor
Tasha and Spencer are tough to beat together!
Spencer and Tasha are on the same team. I hope there is a puzzle. #Survivor
What did Tony expect when he went against his alliance? #Survivor
Spencer and Tasha need to get it together, and own this game. #Survivor
WOW, what a hiding spot. #survivor
OH MY GOSH! I can not believe that, and neither can they! #Survivor
Tasha is happy. She knows she isn't going home. #Survivor
As a fan, I hate not knowing who is going home when we go to tribal. If you are a player, and you don't know, it is you. #Survivor
That reminded me of when Coby and I were the last two Heroes, and were trying to figure out how to get the Villains to kill each other.
Mmmm, boiled clothes soup.
I love a show with two challenges. A little soap opera, a little action, the fallout, a little action, more soap opera, then drama #Survivor
If Tasha can make Tony lose it more, who knows what can happen.
So... Will Spencer use his immunity idol tonight?
I can't believe the brains got the wrong... Oh WAIT. Yes I can. And that Tony got it right. #Survivor
Join us for the inaugural Swing, Pedal, Roar fundraiser in Shelbyville on May 3 and 4. http://t.co/FRmz9DY9cy #Survivor
If it is a popularity challenge, it will REALLY turn up the the on Tony's paranoia. #Survivor
Keep trying Josh #Survivor
I am so glad to see @UnderTheDomeCBS coming back. I love that show!
I think there is still another idol out there and it has special powers. Maybe someone found it and hid the finding from cameraman #Survivor
Those three are each Brains, Beauty, and Brawn. It would be interesting if one from each of the 3 tribes ended up at the finale. #Survivor
When you are at camp starving, and someone is eating a big reward meal... YOU'RE PISSED! #Survivor
LOL I like Woo.
He should be working on his final three out of those six. Tony has the game in his hands, and he is going to lose it. #Survivor
The best thing Rob, Amber, Jenna and I did was stay a solid four, and never broke ranks. If he were smart, he'd keep the six in line.
It would be cool to see those three go on the reward challenge! I am not sure Tony and Spencer like each other even.
#BeastMode #Survivor
You HAVE to let those things go when you are in the majority. @Survivor

Looking for a good tie-dye? I use Tulip's One-Step Tie-Dye kits, it's easy to use, the colors are great, &amp; it's so much fun! @iLoveToCreate
Oh dear. Shhhhhhhhhhhhh #survivor
Umm, the last time I was at an all-you-can-eat steak at Ponderosa, I at 17 steaks. But they were little @BriantheMost23 @Survivor_Tweet
Congrats to @Outback for making all of us hungry during tonight's @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
This has been a great episode of @Survivor_tweet, but I found myself thinking about how many steaks I'd eat during the break. #survivor
A LOT better than last week!
Two safe tribals puts him in the driver's seat.
For being a martial artist master, I figured he'd do a little better.
This is a pain challenge. They are always metal challenges. It shows you who can go far in the game. #Survivor
Yaaaay #survivor
Jeff said there was special power in the idol, and that is a normal idol... So is there another? #Survivor
If I was in my suit, underpants, or skirt those pants NEVER left my sight. #Survivor
When I put things in my pocket, they stay there. I wore zippered pockets on All Stars and Heroes and Villians. #Survivor
If you aren't following @mikeskupin, @monicaculpepper, @JeffProbst, and @Survivor_Tweet on Wednesdays, then what are you waiting on?
Can you BELIEVE he got that, and was smart enough to not share it?! #Survivor
That is heaven in the middle of the game. THAT is a true reward meal. So nourishing. Best steaks I've ever had. #Survivor
Who will be the one to find the hidden immunity??
Any time I won a steak reward, we would eat the steaks until they ran out. You could have more than one. #Survivor
Any time I won a steak reward, we would eat the steaks until they ran out. You could have more than one. #Survivor
Let's see if Spencer can use his brain to start flipping votes. #Survivor
Spencer is using his brain! It's starting to poke through. #survivor
#Survivor loves a good puzzle.
They play the game, but are treated like gold.
Those are extras faking in the challenge preview. They find a body double, and dress them the same. They are the "golden team."
I made sure the Morgan tribe had only the shoes on their feet! #survivor
Even though I am not crazy about Morgan, she is right. Kass has to go! #Survivor
How many pairs of shoes do they have!? #Survivor
Kass is a flip-flopper, and she is still at the bottom of the alliance!

Make sure you check out our Rupert's Kids fundraiser Swing, Pedal, Roar on May 3 and 4, 2014 - http://t.co/FRmz9DY9cy #Survivo
They knew before tribal who had flipped. #Survivor
HA!
That exact attitude is why the brains tribe was ripped apart. #Survivor
I may not be on his side, but I always feel bad for those that go home with an idol. #Survivor
She is going to throw a wrench in everything. #Survivor
Uh oh... Someone thinks they are in control... That usually is a very bad sign for them. #Survivor
Barefoot or shoes in this challenge? Shoes make it hard to grip, but more comfortable flat. Woo has shoes, and isn't slipping. #survivor
If this doesn't last for hours, then they are not trying. #Survivor
There is A LOT of paranoia happening now. #survivor
Haven't they sworn on their badge a couple of times? #Survivor
The you should not have screamed "final five!" when there were 11 left!
With two idols in the game already, how many more can there be?! #Survivor
It is always "us vs. them." Sometimes you just aren't sure who "them" is.
I am in LA this week, so I am watching your tweets to keep up with the action! Can't wait for it to air here.

Hey everyone, keep your eyes glued here! May 3rd and 4th, we are launching the 2nd chapter of Rupert's Kids in Shelbyville, IN!
But they used their brains. Finally. I am happy they did something right! #Survivor
The fact that Spencer was under consideration, the season should be #Survivor #BrawnBeautyDummies
My heart is beating so fast, and I am not even there. I love this game. #Survivor
How are they walking in without a plan? #Survivor #BrawnBeautyDummies
"Bad decisions can cost you a million dollars." - @JeffProbst Kind of sad he has to explain the basics to them. #Survivor
I watched Sandra win two times with the "As long as it isn't me." philosophy. You can think it, just don't say it. #LoyaltytoNone #survivor
It's nice to see that they haven't forgotten the rice
Well, that was painful and exciting at the same time. #Survivor #ILoveChallenges
If Cliff were beaten by Spencer, #GoHome. #Survivor Spencer did that almost single-handedly, though.
LOL! Was she pushing it out to sea!? #Survivor
The Brains are lucky to have Spencer.... But the way they play, they will send him home next. #Survivor
Empty handed? OMG the Brains tribe is KILLING themselves! #Survivor
NEVER throw a challenge! #Survivor
I am excited that we get to return to another challenge! #survivor
He knows he's in the jungle right? If you run up on someone, you'll scare them. He needs to calm down or he is in trouble. #Survivor
That is a beautiful lagoon! I can't believe they aren't pulling fish out of there. #Survivor
I am impressed they actually killed the chicken without fighting for it. #Survivor
So @mikeskupin thought the challenge was funny. THIS is funny. "Are chickens asexual?" #Survivor
How much food does J'Tia have to cost them before they get rid of her? #Survivor
When we one a chicken, we ate it AND the chicken feed. #Survivor
Now will beauty have the strength to kill a chicken? This ought to be good. #Survivor
Please follow the other #survivor from Kokomo, IN - @LindseyOgle28
Waist level? Really? Ouch.
Nice! Lindsey carried that bag by herself. #Survivor
Starting out with a reward challenge! I love it! It has been a while. #Survivor
That was a very long segment of post-tribal council. They were probably up fighting for hours. #Survivor
The hardest night in #Survivor is after Tribal. It makes you go crazy as you figure the new alliances.
Nothing like going out with class. #Survivor
#Survivor loves to blindfold people and make them walk in to things.
It is tough being the first one voted out of your tribe.
Alexis looks terrified. She might need a change of pants. #Survivor
Both of my Pythons are nearly 20 years old.
Inky and Miles. @KC6624
I, too, am at the butterfly stage of my life. #Survivor
After winning #Survivor, my two big burmese pythons got their own sunroom. Wally the Gator is in there as well. @briandalynj
It is amazing how clean they all still look... Maybe because this is the beauty tribe.
I still have my Pearl Islands hammock. It is in the snake room. I was lounging in it the other day. #Survivor
The brains came back! They can't believe it either! #Survivor
Lindsey's face says it all! It is great to win the immunity challenge! #Survivor
Laura and I played this challenge on Heroes and Villains! We almost won. #Survivor
I don't think you get to say anything about rice. #Survivor
At this point, I am worried about the brains tribe mastering a thinking challenge. #Survivor
Laura just said she is thankful it never rained when she was on the island. She is cold looking at this! #Survivor
The rain cuts down on the treachery. There isn't time for shenanigans when you are cold, wet, and miserable. #Survivor
They should change the episode title to, "Pretty Girls Sadly Sitting in the Rain." #survivor
The rain beats you down physically, mentally, emotionally, and if you have a soul, spiritually. #Survivor
In real life, you'd NEVER spend hours wishing you had won a tarp. #survivor
Awww.... that is the most pitiful; shelter ever... But they have fire. #Survivor
And it is still raining....
The rain will kill you. It beats you to death until it stops raining... And sometimes it doesn't stop raining.
Both the brawn and beauty tribes haven't been tested in tribal. They have a strong bond. Until the rain. Now we will see them eat each other
As soon as girl cop needs to throw boy cop under the bus, she will expose him as a liar, and that is all she wrote. #Survivor
If you are going to lie in this game, stick with it. #Survivor
For the brains tribe, you'd think they'd use them! #Survivor
They are already planning on how things happen when they lose the next challenge... Not winning it. #Survivor
Wow.... Karma is a... well, you know.
Just think... If you win and make it through the tribal, you get to go back and sleep in the rain. #Survivor
GREAT landscape shots. They are showing a ton of snakes this year. #survivor
The rain will mentally beat you down. #Survivor
Why would you get rid of Garrett and demolish your chances of winning challenges? #Survivor
I would have never guessed that beauty would win that....
Cliff didn't even need a ladder. #Survivor
I see how strength can help here. Same with brains... Not so much with beauty. #Survivor
I love seeing #Survivor in the top national twitter trends. After 28 seasons, it still generates so much excitement.
They have a saw! What!? #survivor
In #Survivor, being that tall is a disadvantage in the second half of the game. People think big = "he will beat me in challenges."
Newbies got the fire going! Impressive! #Survivor
The first day is the most exciting period of #Survivor, and everyone feels like they are going to win.
I hope Morgan finds an idol... Or a REALLY good excuse... I think most of the male audience would hate to see her go first. #Survivor
Why do I feel like there is a lot of pixelation in Morgan's future?
There is a Hawaiian sling right behind her! Oh my gosh!
He had no problem making that decision for himself.
Put in one tough guy in case you are going to have a challenge! #survivor
At least they aren't throwing someone out in the first 5 minutes. #Survivor
Contestant Lindsey, the hairstylist, is from my hometown, Kokomo, Indiana! #Survivor She is wearing Tie-dye! #TeamTiedye
Even though I love playing the game and enjoy seeing fan favorites, I am always excited to see new players. #Survivor
It is always amazing how people think they are going to be the winner before the game starts. It isn't easy to win.

A million dollars can REALLY make a person lose focus, and she has lost focus. #Survivor
When you are caught doing something in the middle of the jungle... You end up feeling really awkward. And it happens a lot. #Survivor
Watching this on TV makes me crazy. It is so emotional after playing with everyone, no matter how brief. #Survivor
Tina, you did da%$ good. #Survivor
#Survivor is hard enough. Bringing in the family element makes the game insane. The players insane...
What else is she going to say?! #Survivor
I wish this was my redemption challenge. I am REALLY good at tying things together. Not a challenge needing agility &amp; delicacy #NotDelicate
One thing about being too confident is that soon you become a sloppy player. #Survivor
They are starting to burn the furniture! #Survivor

Tyson may be cocky, but he is controlling the game, and is going to the final 4 with an idol.  #Survivor
I bet Tyson is going to regret not playing that idol! #Survivor
They are doing everything but physically tearing her apart! This is one heckuva tug of war over Ciera! #Survivor
No one loves to stir the pot like @JeffProbst! #Survivor
You have to give it to Hayden... He is trying like heck, and is making sense. But I think he is in trouble. #Survivor
And now we see the split... 3 vs. 3. #Survivor
I feel like we haven't heard more than 10 words from Monica this season. #Survivor
It is SO hard to stick to a plan. I wondered how they can get to drawing a rock tonight, and now I see it. #Survivor
This time the hint actually is to an idol that is out there, up for grabs. #Survivor
Congratulations Tina. Hope it is a small ray of sunshine in a dark week. Hope you know you're loved out there and we are sorry for your loss
And there you go... #Survivor
Caleb just needs to stop right there. Leave it alone!

It isn't good when you are talking, and everyone is looking down, and not in your eye. #Survivor
Ooooh, Sharks in the water. I loved hunting when the sharks were in the water.  #Survivor
These rewards sound SO GOOD on the island, but when you haven't eaten in days, sometimes they aren't rewards. #survivor
Nothing is more rewarding after a hot day of challenges than a giant vat of greasy fried chicken. #Reward? #Survivor
Booooooo #Survivor
Laura forgot! It is ALWAYS OK to vote out anyone but YOU! #Survivor
YEAH! Go Laura! #TeamTieDye #Survivor
After my first season, I never spent more than 20 or 30 minutes away from the tribe. #survivor
The more you stay away from your tribe, the easier it is to conspire against you. #Survivor
And excited claps from the audience.... #Enthusiasm #Survivor
Wow, it is nice they got some sharp machetes! #Survivor
Kat needs to focus. I lost because I wasn't able to focus. It's tough! #Survivor #survivorbloodvswater

I have to go, but thanks to everyone for an awesome season of #survivor. I can't wait to do it next season!
Yes, they really do not know for that amount of time. #survivor

Love it that @BostonRob and Rudy are there! Cool! #survivorfinale #survivor
Congratulations @JohnMCochran!! Very cool. #survivorfinale #survivor
LOL "@ashton_tatka: @RupertBoneham @MariaYahm MARIA HE TWEETED US BACK!!!!!!‚Äù
Good move by Brenda, or uncomfortable? #survivor
Wow. This is getting crazy. #survivor #survivorfinale
Sherri, what are you thinking? #survivor
Erik is showing that bitterness you feel after you are on that jury. You are miserable.
Tell me how this is not entertaining? #survivor
Let the hair loose Malcolm! #survivor
#survivor: Will Smith edition
Cochran is a Harvard Law
Student? Guess we know where that $1M is going!
Who will win player of the season? @Survivor_Tweet #survivorfinale #survivor
My money is on @JohnMCochran. He is well spoken and earned it. Sherri hasn't earner it, and Dawn has baggage. #survivorfinale #survivor
Sherri, you are in the final 4... Don't tell everyone you're a threat. #survivor
Don't you all think Brenda has shared what Dawn did with the jury? You are angry when you are on the jury. Dawn's crying gets old. #survivor
Eddie still has Andrea, Malcolm, Reynold, maybe Phillip. Maybe Sherri 2nd as fan. Then Dawn. So I'd want Dawn #survivor
Cochran is starting to dominate this game. Could you have that predicted it at the beginning of the season? #survivor #survivorfinale
These challenges are so big and beautiful. I just love it. This looks like so much fun. #survivorfinale #survivor
The tweet poll here shows that everyone feels worse for Erik over Brenda by a large margin. #survivor #notscientific
Fans love or dislike @PSheppardTV, but he is good on #survivor. Plain and simple. He's fun to watch.
Who do you feel more sorry for: Erik or Brenda? #survivorfinale #survivor
Say what you want about Phillip... He is great on #survivor #entertainment
#teambigbeard #survivor
Strength isn't just about how much you can lift... #survivor
Oh Shamar... Are you really a strong guy? His mind was not tough enough for the game. #survivor
The #survivorfinale moment when you say, Oh I remember them... And "Wow, that aired a long time ago."
My prediction is that Eddie is going to win. He has the votes on the jury. #survivor
They make them look like superheroes in the open. So cool. #survivor
Who's going to win?? #survivor
Death threats are unacceptable. If you would not say it to someone's face then do not tweet it. #survivor
This is a tv show and a fun game. This is not life or death and the person on the other end of twitter has feelings. Act grown. #survivor
I've been asked about Dawn deleting her account on twitter, and my response is the same as with Abi last year. #survivor
Happy Mother's Day to my sweet momma Georgette and to all of the mothers out there!
Eddie has Phillip, Reynold, Amanda, Malcolm, and possibly Sherri. It just takes 5. #Survivor
Brenda shouldn't have given Dawn her tooth back. #Survivor
I am now rooting for @SURVIVOReddie #Survivor
You people are disgusting. #Survivor
The easy vote is the smart vote! Look at the jury! #Survivor
Who is going home? @Survivor_Tweet #Survivor
Sherri doesn't even come up! They are so blind... #PowerofShuttingUp #Survivor
If Eddie is in the final 3, he's going to win. #Survivor #Fans
You are seriously getting rid of Brenda for being nice? #Survivor
DO NOT Leave Sherri on that on that island to be the final 4 or 3 with a jury full of fans... #Survivor
Anyone vote for Phillip? #Survivor
We LOVE Malcolm and Cochran... But we are giving our votes to BIG BEARD! Go Matt! #Solidarity #Survivor
Hmmm, #15 Big Beard or #14 Malcom or #5 Cochran.... #survivor
Wow... Can I see that again...
That is the best thing Brenda could have done... Show Dawn is stronger than you.
I love challenges that force you to compete with yourself. #Survivo
Eddie and Sherri... Fans... Focus... #Survivor
I feel so bad for @meehand #survivor
Oh man... They have to watch and listen?! Ouch. #Survivor
I would ask Laura (my wife) if everyone could go. It is a great strategic move this late in the game. #Survivor
That is so mean... lol #Survivor
Oh, that is AWESOME! #survivor
He didn't say you HAVE to do it that way. Why not sit down and spin it. #Survivor
#Fatherhood is getting to @JeffProbst... :) #Survivor
HEY EVERYONE! Look how humble I am! #survivor
When I got it on Heroes and Villians, I tried calling home. Didn't work. #YouNeverKnow #survivor
It is SO GOOD to see the loved ones, even if it has been just a month. It feels like a lifetime in the pain. #Survivor
Less than a week left and he is losing it. #Survivor
The stickers go upwards... All those little needles HURT when you shimmy down. #Survivor
Go out and find food! Look at that ocean! It's full of food! Argh. #Survivor
It is so easy to get caught up in all of the silly planning. #survivor

People ask what they are doing in the sand. They are bathing. You get in the ocean and scrub with sand to get clean and de-funked #Survivor
My replies are turning on Andrea because she is sneaky. Isn't that how you are supposed to play #Survivor
We are voting for Cochran! The girls may have won the challenge, but Cochran is using his mind this season. He didn't use anything last time
Ok everyone... Eddie or Andrea tonight? #Survivor
Eric, you couldn't carry two? #Survivor
Loved ones are probably coming next week, so you DO NOT want to lose this one. #Survivor
COOL challenge, @Survivor_Tweet! #Survivor
Some these challenges are so big! It can take days with an army of guys to build them. #Survivor
Look at Cochran! Big move spilling the beans. It should be Eddie, but I think it will be Andrea. #survivor
Andrea is going to end up pushing her way right out of this game. #Survivor
The favorites stuck together, so that is something, I guess. #Survivor
That is a fractured tribe. #Survivor
Paranoia will destroy you... But it doesn't mean they aren't out to get you! #Survivor
Malcom has pretty lady hair. lol #Survivor
Phillip with the hipster glasses. #Survivor
Tribal at 8:23? Maybe one long tribal? Or two? Got a lot of people with two shows left. #Survivor
If they vote out another favorite, they better be careful because there are still 3 fans. #Survivor
If I found an idol, finders keeps. What in the world was he thinking? #Survivor
Man, they are all looking REALLY skinny. At this point in the game, you've lost most of your fat. #Survivor
I would read it, rip it up, and throw it in the ocean right there. #survivor
They both showed they are forces in this game. #Survivor
Brenda, YOU PICKED THE LEG!! #Survivor
Two people on the same alliance that clearly do not trust each other... #Survivor
Bend the knees, squat, and get the center of gravity lower... #Survivor
So Cochran was putting all of the pressure on the women, and they have smaller feet and less weight, so they can win! #Survivor
I'd NEVER give up for food. Would you? #Survivor
Why aren't they in the middle and balancing? #Survivor
Eddie... You could have just lost the game! #survivor
They LOVE testing your feet in this game. Broken toes would be the worst... #Survivor
Another tribal the very next day... #Survivor That is tough mentally.
#Survivor has that effect on people.
Let's see how tough Cochran is! Eric and Cochran can control this game. #survivor

Poor Malcolm. I guess we are team Cochran. #Survivor
I cannot believe it. #Survivor
A strength challenge is my favorite. It is 90% mental. #survivor
Love letters are so valuable to your mental state in the game, even if it is a few words. #survivor
Twitter seems a little slow tonight. So let's do this. Who has a question? #survivor
Mmmm, that I might buy. #Survivor
Don't you want love letters!? But that chicken does look good! #Survivor
With the auction coming, that means the love letters are coming! I would bet it all for a letter from my wife and daughter! #Survivor
How many tie-dye t-shirts do I have? This many. #survivor http://t.co/oco48a3BUs

That was probably the best tribal council ever. Do you agree? #Survivor @Survivor_Tweet
I AM going to miss Phillip... He is entertaining to watch! #survivor
They stayed to their word, and Phillip is going home. #Survivor
He didn't want to play it. #Survivor
Good.
I would play it! PLAY IT MALCOLM! #Survivor
Good grief... @Survivor_Tweet is showing why it is still the best show on TV. I cannot wait for the results. #Survivor
Wow... He is coming off arrogant, but he is trying to ensure those idols do not have to get played. #Survivor
I don't think Malcolm shouldn't have played it that way. He should have let them throw their chips on the table first. #Survivor
Totally understandable Phillip. #survivor
If that is truly a second idol, Malcolm can change the game in a huge way tonight. What if both get played. #Survivor
Let's speculate. Was that his idol, and he wanted to tip his hand? #Survivor
I CANNOT believe how many idoles are in this game. #survivor
Malcolm MIGHT think there is a 2nd idol, but they've never put a 2nd idol in to play after merge. #Survivor
When you get too cocky is when you run in to problems. #Survivor
#TeamMalcolm
We're voting for Reynold. Although we're team Malcolm in the Boneham household because he's doing back to back. #survivor
No, you don't get to keep the cool immunity necklaces. #survivor
I ALMOST won this challenge in Pearl Islands. I lost to Burton by a hair, and he gave me the immunity at tribal. #survivor
That is how secure he feels in his alliance... #Survivor
Fire ants, sand fleas, and other bugs... That's why I never slept in the sand! #Survivor
Poor @meehand The music tells us she's losing it. #survivor
Phillip... Gross... #Survivor
Not even close. #Survivor
Bad Luck Cochran: Second chance on survivor. Drowns in mud challenge. #Survivor
That optimistic musics says they WILL find that tooth! #Survivor
OK, I can understand that... I totally feel for her as someone with teeth issue! #Survivor
Man, that didn't take long... #Survivor
I LOVE to see Cochran using Phillip. #Survivor
They a teasing a Dawn meltdown. Hopefully that takes some heat off of Malcolm, since he has some explaining to do. #Survivor
Be one of the helpers. http://t.co/4nEVbZ4Baa

I have a feeling next week, Andrea will be yelling at the tribe: "WHO VOTED  FOR ME?! WHO VOTED FOR ME?!" #Survivor
Malcolm has an idol, and he voted for Reynold... And he just took Reynold's idol. #INSANE #survivor WOW
Does Malcolm still have one in his pocket? #Survivor
Oh my gosh. #Survivor
I cannot even predict who is going home. #survivor
Why have a secret alliance if you tell everyone who is in the alliance? #Survivor
The hour after tribal council is even worse! #survivor
That hour before tribal council is the WORST. Think of the most nerve wracking, anxious moment in life and add starvation. #survivor
I think @meehand has a real shot at this in the end. #suvivor
Andrea needs to shut up and listen to Dawn... And Dawn might just need to shut up! Danger! Danger! #Survivor
Has anyone seen Brenda on the show until this week? #Survivor
How is Brenda not on there? But we're voting for Malcolm. #Survivor
Rick Ocasek of the Cars would have ruled at that challenge. #survivor http://t.co/qe7CZJ9z8N
This shows you the most mentally tough players. This takes EVERY bit of discipline and focus you have. #Survivor
This is a challenge designed for people with small faces! #Survivor
These are mental challenges more than physical challenges! They are scary because you feel like you are drowning. #Survivor
I hope Malcolm plays the immunity idol tonight It's easy to get lost in the game and you lose focus on what's happning around you. #survivor
One day you feel great from a reward with a full belly, and it can take the fight out of you the next day. You pay for it. #survivor
Cochran is so pale. How is he not bright pink? But I guess you can always find shade in the jungle. #Survivor
A challenge in the first 8 minutes! Woo hoo! #survivor
The snake chasing the baby monkey might be a foreshadowing... #Survivor
I have been looking forward to #Survivor all week! I am interested to see if the favorites can bond back together.
If you already follow me and I haven't followed you back, let me know so I can #fb.

Thank you very much following me. Be sure to check out http://t.co/VGdK38qrT2 and see how U can help R-Kids program THNX! Talk to U next wk
Good for you Corinne. That's the way you've got to look at it. #Survivor
If Philip thought he was strong B4 he is going to be out of control now. I hope Malcolm can get back into favorite's alliance. #Survivor
If the favorites don't vote together in a block next I will be shocked #Survivor
If the favorites don't vote together in a block next I will be shocked #Survivor
If that didn't send a message through the favorites to keep in line, I don't know what will. #Survivor
WOW! #Survivor
12 people to vote. - that 's a long tribal council. Neither one of them #Survivor
Let's see what they are going to do... #Survivor
Why do they use Philip to go talk to the others? Why? #Survivor
We give our vote to Cochran, even though I like Dawn. She's going to have to step up her game more #Survivor
Cochran is opening up his eyes! #Survivor
If Philip gets greedy, they'll turn the vote against him. #Survivor
I hope Malcom doesn't get too cocky or evil #Survivor
Good for Cochran! #Survivor
I can't believe how good Cochran is  doing! #Survivor
Eddie was trying to shove it down with his fingers. That was dedication #Survivor
These are nasty. The worst thing that I ate was the jungle chicken eggs that were like these #Survivor
the less you chew the better off you are. Don't bite! #Survivor
Quit chewing and swallow! #Survivor
They've got pinchers #Survivor
Nasty food challenge! #Survivor
Good. First individual challenge for immunity! #Survivor
Philip is actually saying he may not win it - best way to succeed in the game. #Survivor
Dyslexia kicking in tonight. Apologies to all those I mispell. #Survivor
Pretty Close - I'm still waiting for that stand out player. #Survivor
Merge! and the favorites are strong! #Survivor
I guess Raymond has his idol pretty close to him. He didn't go running off #Survivor
It's not "Boat Mail" - it's a taxi!  #Survivor
Now, can Dawn actually stand up and do that? #Survivor
Stay strong Dawn. She could actually win this game! #Survivor
Unless Philip continues on with trying to manipulate the game (true or not) - it could be he who goes home #Survivor
Once the merge happens and it turns into an individual game, it will probably be time to get rid of strongest fans first #Survivor
Eddie might be left high and dry this week! #Survivor
Been lookin forward to this 1 all week. Looking 4ward to the merge #Survivor

I think Michael is going home. #survivor
If Phillip stays this week, my twitter feed will be filled with Abi-level hate next week. #survivor
Phillip thinks he's still playing with Boston Rob. #survivor
LOL! "The spy's basic tool is the grappling hook." What is this, Spy vs. Spy? #Survivor http://t.co/033SfG7GCQ
Phillip has a confession. This ought to be good. #Survivor
I am voting for Reynold today! #Survivor
These challenges seem like minutes, but they can last hours! The jumpy music speeds things up. #Survivor
I hope Malcolm doesn't try to do too much too fast. It can really bite you in the rear. #Survivor
Women do not shave their armpits on the island. Some will use razor sharp clam shells to shear off their pit hair. #Survivor
Why does Phillip have zero armpit hair? #Survivor #Uhhhhh
"You Tubby Lunch Box!" #Survivor
It looks so good, but your body is NOT ready for that kind of food. It makes you sick out there. #Survivor
Bets on who throws it up first? #Survivor
LOL! They won on "strategy." The other side had PHILLIP on their team. #Survivor
Guys, cut him some slack. He has a weak lower body. Remember? #Survivor
Phillip gave himself a little ego boost. Just what he needs. #Survivor
Cool! A reward challenge. I love the challenges, especially the food rewards. #Survivor

So next week, the thing to look for is Phillip explaining how the strongest on the team stumbled in the challenge. #survivor
I hope Malcolm doesn't get too cocky. But I am rooting for him! #Survivor
#BeardSolidarity #Survivor
He had strength AND loyalty AND a killer beard. What were you thinking? #Survivor
Wow, all over the board.... Don't get rid of the beard! #Survivor
Do any of them have an idol? I forget. I think Reynold is the only one with the idol in the whole game. #Survivor
Here is the social side of the game: Just staying quiet while people implode, rant, and play the game poorly. #Survivor
People think he's the ring leader, but it just appears that way because the nice people don't speak up against the loud &amp; crazy #LifeLesson
Phillip... SHHHHHHH #Survivor
Who gets the vote? I voted for Malcolm. #Survivor
What? #Survivor
It's that part in the season when you start seeing people in the game that haven't had any screen time and you go, "Who is that?" #Survivor
We haven't seen Phillip make fire, but it looks he is about to fulfill Brandon's promise of burning the shelter down. #Survivor
In All Stars we shuffled in to a new camp part of the way through. It was great to see what new toys you had. #Survivor
If Eddie and Reynold can keep 4 strong, they will be in the finale. #Survivor
#DropYourBuffs #Survivor
While we are listening to little beard ramble, go like the Rupert's Kids facebook page for me. #Survivor https://t.co/flWEpICD2m
Challenge Time! Will Phillip rule the day again? #Survivor
#OperationThunderbolt #Survivor
Why are these people so unhappy? They all essentially got immunity, AND got rid of Brandon? #Survivor
Phillip doesn't realize it yet, but he is now the craziest person on the island! #Survivor
I am so interested to see who gets a second chance in the two new tribes. #Survivor
